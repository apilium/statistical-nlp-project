"Martina McBride has one of those proverbial “could sing the phone book” voices.Fortunately, the country star has chosen much richer material for her second covers album, “Everlasting.’’

After reverently dipping into the classic country songbook on 2005’s “Timeless,” the thematically similar “Everlasting” — produced by Don Was and her first self-release on Vinyl Recordings — finds the mighty-voiced McBride deftly tackling a clutch of pop, soul, and blues tunes complete with horns, a sultry Southern organ sound, and heavenly harmonies from the McCrary Sisters.Unsurprisingly, McBride offers solid renditions of well-known ballads like “If You Don’t Know Me by Now” and “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long,” the latter an intimate confessional."
