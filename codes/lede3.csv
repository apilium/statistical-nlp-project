[...] in the mix were t-shirted members of something called “team f— it up,” a rubik’s cube, an ersatz golden state warriors starting five, a woman wearing a t-shirt that said “sometimes i open my mouth and my mother comes out,” along with any number of batmen, supermen and spider-men.  halfway through the course, on the fabled, fearsome hayes street hill,  the extra weight from all the heavy costumes was making their owners work twice as hard as their fellow runners in lycra.  a dozen people carried a 20-foot-long star destoyer spaceship from the “star wars” film franchise.  instead of blasting out laser weapons, it blasted out dance music, attracting hordes of other runners who danced beside the space ship as they ran."
