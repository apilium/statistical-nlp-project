"ossining in 1825, inmates from new york's first state prison were barged down the hudson river from auburn to begin work on their new home here. lingering distaste for the red brick prison on the hill was sharpened in the minds of many ossining residents recently when governor carey found legislative support for his proposal to spend $24.6 million on nearly 600 new beds at ossining. engel, a democrat, said the correctional facility ''is sitting on probably the most valuable piece of real estate in the community'' and should be developed with ''luxury, high-income housing that would bring some money into ossining and some damn-well needed tax income.'' this is the closest one to new york city, where nothing else is available. he also suggested that the facility make a payment in lieu of taxes to the village, not just to the school district, which has received between $16,000 and $40,000 a year from the facility over the years. it was once the home of the warden and is now used for offices. ritchie added that upstate communities with prisons such as clinton and attica had fewer choices for development because of their sites. with a hillside and views up and down the hudson, ''we can do something far more valuable,'' he noted. he said that many prison employees live in new york city, long island and new jersey. the family bond plays a very important role in helping them make reentry to society.''","ossining in 1825, inmates from new york's first state prison were barged down the hudson river from auburn to begin work on their new home here. they quarried local limestone and built on the edge of the river the first cell block for what was to become the state's second prison.   the gray stone building, its windows sealed in disuse, still stands next to the conrail right-of-way, a reminder of the days when the ossining correctional facility was known as sing-sing prison.   the intervening years brought notoriety to this community whose lights used to flicker when the switch was pulled on the electric chair in death row. the chair itself was sent to green haven prison in dutchess county about five years ago, but ossining's ''up-theriver'' reputation remains, and there are those here who have always wished the prison would go away."

"fortune — what songs best describe your work ethic? you may think such questions could produce useful insights. but are your interview questions any better? managers tend to think of interviewing job candidates as “something that’s easy,” says pamela skillings, president and chief trainer at skillful communications in new york. all too often, they get a penguin in a sombrero. but experts say such prosaic questions produce answers of little use. rather than focusing on eliciting the answers they need, inexperienced interviewers often ask rote questions that “bounce along the surface without getting to know the real person behind the interview hype,” says paul falcone, author of 96 great interview questions to ask before you hire. “ you’ll never learn anything while you’re talking.” by the end, they realize they didn’t know things, or were rusty.”",managers often think that they have reached a career level where they have been magically imbued with the gift of giving a good job interview. it doesn't work that way.

nfl teams now have the power to stop television blackouts of their home games, but that doesn't mean they'll do so. it's up to the teams' owners to decide if they want to adopt that 85 percent threshold. manning left for denver this year and though no. they could have done that without a new stadium. when i look around the league, most are staying with the old rule."" um, mike, maybe it's because you threatened to move the team back in 1995. the team declined the nfl's offer to lift blackouts at 85 percent capacity, largely because doing so would require it to pay $90,000 per home game into the league's anti-blackout revenue pool. the price to retain its disgruntled fan base or bring in new generations of fans is likely a bit higher. the fact remains, though, that the jacksonville economy still isn't great, the team hasn't made the playoffs since 2007 and was bad enough last year to warrant coach jack del rio's firing, sponsors such as anheuser-busch are still buying up tickets to avoid blackouts and new owner shahid khan refuses to commit to a future in jacksonville. more from the street -- 10 london summer olympics brands you can't escape -- 10 best vacation cities for beer lovers -- 8 most expensive sports championship tickets -- 7 sports teams and venues that pay you to watch games
