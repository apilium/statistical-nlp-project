"bangalore, india, june 4  the world's biggest computer services company could not have chosen a more appropriate setting to lay out its strategy for staying on top. on tuesday, on the expansive grounds of the bangalore palace, a colonial-era mansion once inhabited by a maharajah, the chairman and chief executive of i.b.m., an additional 6,500 employees will look in on the town hall-style meeting by satellite from other indian cities. 's work force in india has been remarkable. some of the growth has been through acquisition. in a deal valued at about $160 million in 2004, i.b.m. bought daksh eservices of new delhi, india's third-largest back-office outsourcing firm with 6,000 workers. in recent months, the technology hub of bangalore has become the center of i.b.m. researchers have fashioned a predictable modeling system that helps track the failure of components inside a vehicle, a potentially important tool. these kinds of capabilities and global scale are unmatched."" but smaller rivals are playing catch-up here, too, by talking to customers about their needs and then developing custom-built software. even so, the indian operation is becoming more and more strategic for the company. """,india provides i.b.m. with its fastest-growing market and a crucial base for delivering services to much of the world.

"in 1713, when he was only 25 years old, alexander pope assumed a momentous risk. but there has been a rejection of that rejection. pope's own formulas no longer look so un-homeric. steven shankman, a professor of english and classics at the university of oregon, eugene, and director of the oregon humanities center, remedies that shameful neglect with a new pope's ''iliad'' (''the iliad of homer translated by alexander pope,'' penguin, $22.95), completely re-editing the poem from pope's last published edition (the twickenham works from the first edition), modernizing the spelling and - most important - including pope's extensive notes, which show how carefully pope weighed the possible meanings of the original. though he was careful about it, he was working with 18th-century conventions and his audience's knowledge of the heroic couplet's possibilities. the sputtering rage of achilles is marked by double caesuras and stammering short u sounds (-ious, thus, -rupt-) in this couplet's second line:

"cambridge — ask charlie kohlhase a question about jazz history. “i grew up at a time when people were really interested in free jazz. and i think you miss that today,” says charlie kohlhase. though his formal education didn’t extend beyond high school, the self-made musician complemented his copious listening habits with private instruction from saxophonist stan strickland and trombonist roswell rudd, plus the less-formal tutelage of the late john tchicai, a friend and sometime-collaborator who’d played sax with the likes of ayler and coltrane. with his explorer’s club, which kohlhase says he named with an eye toward something “with a boy scout-ish image but also the potential for some subversion,” he presents free-roaming compositions meant to highlight the musical ideas of his collaborators. ( depending on availability, the group may grow from three to nine players. that’s a clever way to run a band — to keep it fun like it’s a hang, but to get creative work done where everyone's contributing.” “i’m 100 percent sure he remembers what it was,” gershon says.","ask charlie kohlhase a question about jazz history. if you’re wondering about, say, an obscure studio session from the 1960s, there’s a good enough chance he’ll have a copy of it in his home collection, which numbers over 10,000 lps and a few thousand more cds. kohlhase—a saxophonist, songwriter, educator and radio host who has led various free-jazz-minded ensembles in the area since 1980—achieved his stature as the boston area’s walking encyclopedia of jazz simply by listening to, and playing, lots of music. a native of portsmouth, new hampshire, he hung around unh for eight years, but not in the classrooms—he started djing on college radio while still a sophomore in high school. he brings his explorer’s club trio to outpost 186 on thursday."
