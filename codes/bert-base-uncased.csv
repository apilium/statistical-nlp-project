a building housing i.b.m.'s software laboratory and application service teams on the company's corporate campus in bangalore, india.

on tuesday, on the expansive grounds of the bangalore palace, a colonial-era mansion once inhabited by a maharajah, the chairman and chief executive of i.b.m., samuel j. palmisano, will address 10,000 indian employees. he will share the stage with a. p. j. abdul kalam, india's president, and sunil mittal, chairman of the country's largest cellular services provider, bharti tele-ventures. an additional 6,500 employees will look in on the town hall-style meeting by satellite from other indian cities.

on the same day, mr. palmisano and other top executives will meet here with investment analysts and local customers to showcase i.b.m.'s global integration capabilities in a briefing customarily held in new york. during the week, the company will lead the 50 analysts on a tour of its indian operations.

the meetings are more than an exercise in public and investor relations. they are an acknowledgment of india's critical role in i.b.m.'s strategy, providing it with its fastest-growing market and a crucial base for delivering services to much of the world.

""a significant part of any large project that we do worldwide is today being delivered out of here,"" said shanker annaswamy, i.b.m.'s managing director for india, who presides over what is now the company's second-largest worldwide operation. in the last few years, even as the company has laid off thousands of workers in the united states and europe, the growth in i.b.m.'s work force in india has been remarkable. from 9,000 employees in early 2004, the number has grown to 43,000 (out of 329,000 worldwide), making i.b.m. the country's largest multinational employer.

some of the growth has been through acquisition. in a deal valued at about $160 million in 2004, i.b.m. bought daksh eservices of new delhi, india's third-largest back-office outsourcing firm with 6,000 workers. since then, that operation alone has grown to 20,000 employees.

""now that companies such as infosys technologies and cognizant have clearly demonstrated that the services marketplace is not impregnable, the new battle is for talent,"" said n. lakshmi narayanan, president and chief executive of cognizant technology solutions of teaneck, n.j. cognizant is one of i.b.m.'s competitors; it is incorporated in the united states but has the bulk of its 28,000 employees in india.

i.b.m. is growing not only in size by adding new hires, but also in revenue. the company's business in india grew 61 percent in the first quarter of this year, 55 percent in 2005 and 45 percent the year before.

that growth has not come just from taking advantage of the country's pool of low-cost talent. in recent months, the technology hub of bangalore has become the center of i.b.m.'s efforts to combine high-value, cutting-edge services with its low-cost model.

for instance, the i.b.m. india research lab, with units in bangalore and new delhi and a hundred employees with ph.d.'s, has created crucial products like a container tracking system for global shipping companies and a warranty management system for automakers in the united states. out of the second project, i.b.m. researchers have fashioned a predictable modeling system that helps track the failure of components inside a vehicle, a potentially important tool.

in march, the company started a global business solutions center here, announcing that it would represent the ""future of consulting services."" i.b.m. said that it expected to invest more than $200 million a year in the new center. the company hopes to provide clients with access to the expertise of its 60,000 consultants worldwide in complex areas like supply chain management and compliance with banking rules.

but competitors are trying to gain on i.b.m. the rival consulting firm, accenture, based in hamilton, bermuda, is ramping up equally rapidly in india, while another outsourcing competitor, electronic data systems, based in plano, tex., recently made an offer for a controlling stake in mphasis, a midsize outsourcing firm in bangalore.

the race for india's skilled, inexpensive talent may not stop at i.b.m. ""many companies in the technology development and support niche covet and value these workers highly,"" said kevin m. moss, a new york-based special counsel in kramer levin naftalis & frankel's outsourcing and technology transactions group.

on the pricing front, rivals like tata consultancy services of mumbai and infosys technologies of bangalore have pioneered and perfected the low-cost model. infosys technologies, with 52,700 employees, has $2.15 billion in annual revenues, a figure that is growing 30 percent annually.

but the depth, breadth and geographic spread of i.b.m.'s global operations  which generated $91 billion in sales last year, $47 billion from services  keep it ahead of its competitors for now. for example, i.b.m. manages a system it developed for a large american oil company, which it would not identify, that keeps track of consumption and oversees financial and administrative processes as well as the technical help desk, data network and servers. i.b.m. is also researching tools to track company assets and reduce costs.

""all this is done for one customer seamlessly from three of our centers in bangalore, chicago and outside of london,"" said amitabh ray, director of global delivery, i.b.m. global services. ""these kinds of capabilities and global scale are unmatched.""

but smaller rivals are playing catch-up here, too, by talking to customers about their needs and then developing custom-built software. infosys technologies, for instance, has a consulting unit with headquarters in fremont, calif., near silicon valley, where it now has 200 consultants, and an additional 1,800 consultants in india.

meanwhile, mr. annaswamy, i.b.m.'s chief executive in india, acknowledged that growth was difficult because thousands of recruits had to be quickly integrated into the company. salaries are rising, and employee costs are also moving up, he said.

even so, the indian operation is becoming more and more strategic for the company. ""both in terms of size and scale, india has become the focal point,"" mr. ray, of i.b.m. global services, said."

as many black men marched on washington yesterday, some new yorkers spoke of their pride in the event and their disappointment in not being there, too.

but some other black new yorkers said they had no use for march organizer louis farrakhan and made no apologies for missing the rally.

""farrakhan's wrong,"" said allen washington, 61, a retired triborough bridge and tunnel authority worker. ""whites and blacks need each other. if we worked together, we'd be a great nation.""

""louis farrakhan shouldn't be at the march because of the remarks he has made about jews and whites,"" agreed brooklyn construction worker cyril peter, 35. ""as long as he's there, there will be a negative effect.""

charles williams, 45, an east elmhurst, queens, graphics worker, decided that the event was hollow. ""there is no agenda,"" he said. ""it isn't about jobs or housing, it's just about a paper platform.""

still, drug counselor jeanette morgan was bursting with hope and pride as she sipped coffee in a queens diner and thought about her brothers, sons and grandsons marching in washington.

""i am so emotional about this day, i can barely talk about it,"" morgan said. ""when the men return, i hope they go to their brothers at a street corner and offer to help.""

on one harlem corner yesterday, college student mike carr stood shaking his head as he watched a man idly nurse a 40-ounce beer in a bag.

""it's a shame,"" said carr. ""these are the brothers who could have used the march the most."""

tehran (reuters) - an american woman who was freed after more than a year in an iranian jail on suspicion of spying has been summoned back to attend trial, the official irna news agency reported monday.

sarah shourd, 32, was arrested in july 2009 along with two male friends, shane bauer and josh fattal who are still in jail in iran.

shourd, who may opt to not return, a move which would delay any trial of bauer and fattal, said the trio were hiking in the mountains area of iraq near the iranian border and never intended to cross into iran.

a trial set for last november was postponed, according to a judiciary spokesman, because of shourd's absence.

""sarah shourd ... has been summoned by the revolutionary court to be present at next trial session,"" judiciary spokesman gholamhosssein mohseni-ejei was quoted as saying monday. the trial is set for february 6.

shourd was released on $500,000 bail in september on humanitarian grounds and returned to the united states.

under iran's islamic law, espionage can be punished by execution.

""the hearing will be held on scheduled date unless in some exceptional cases such as their lawyers' formal requests,"" ejei said.

the case has further complicated relations between iran and the united states which have had no diplomatic relations since the 1979 islamic revolution.

washington has headed a global campaign to tighten sanctions on tehran which it accuses of seeking nuclear weapons. iran says its nuclear program is peaceful, aimed at generating electricity.

washington | fri aug 17, 2007 6:02pm edt

washington (reuters) - a vaccine designed to treat breast cancer appeared to be safe in women with advanced disease and showed signs of actually slowing down tumors, u.s. researchers reported on friday.

dendreon corporation, maker of the provenge prostate cancer vaccine, calls the new vaccine neuvenge. it targets a type of breast cancer called her2/neu-positive breast cancer, which affects between 20 percent and 30 percent of breast cancer patients.

like provenge, neuvenge is made using immune cells from the cancer patient, so it is a tailor-made vaccine.

dr. john park of the university of california, san francisco and colleagues tested it in 18 women with advanced her2/neu-positive breast cancer, whose cancer had spread despite treatment.

writing in the journal of clinical oncology, the researchers said the vaccine did not cause any serious side effects and appeared to help at least one patient.

""we saw a partial response, meaning a reduction in the size of tumor area in one patient that was certainly attributable to the treatment,"" park said in a telephone interview.

in three other women, their cancer appeared to stabilize for as long as a year, something that could have been due to treatment, park said.

park said the effects justify moving from the phase 1 safety trial to a phase 2 trial, which would be designed to show the treatment actually helps patients. but that may not happen for a while, he said.

""the sponsor of this vaccine technology, dendreon, is also associated with provenge,"" park said.

""we on the breast cancer side are trying to encourage them to develop neuvenge with the same vigor that they have tried to apply to provenge, but it is not a company that has unlimited resources.""

in january, the u.s. food and drug administration accepted dendreon's marketing application for provenge on a ""fast-track"" basis, and in march an advisory panel said provenge appeared reasonably safe. but the fda has asked dendreon to show the vaccine helps prostate cancer patients actually live longer.

dr. dave urdal, chief scientific officer at seattle-based dendreon, said that data would not be available any sooner than next year, and perhaps not until 2010.

""the company currently is focused on its lead product, provenge, so moving forward with the neuvenge product is something that we haven't given guidance on,"" urdal said in a telephone interview.

the delay in approval of provenge has angered some patient advocacy groups.

urdal said both provenge and neuvenge make use of immune system cells called cd4 helper t-cells.

""this validates the approach. so there is more than one target and more than one cancer that potentially will benefit from this form of therapy,"" he said. other companies are also working on cancer vaccines.

the her2/neu protein is over-expressed, meaning it is over-active, in several tumors including breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer.

the vaccine is a therapeutic vaccine, meaning it stimulates an immune response to existing disease. the patient's t-cells are removed, ""trained"" to recognize the her2/neu protein, and then re-infused into the patient."

at the 2,400-capacity house of blues, the bassist and drummer planted themselves at either end of the large stage and bugg took the center, clutching a classical acoustic guitar. from the opening dylan-esque word-spree “there's a beast and we all feed it,” the singer's evident absorption in the music captivated the notably diverse crowd, and he won cheers simply by wandering here or glancing there.

the excitement held firm through the first eight numbers, each a striking uptempo amalgam of old folk, skiffle, and rockabilly styles, climaxing with the instantly winning “two fingers” and — after bugg switched to electric guitar — the new “messed up kids.” the mood ebbed during a couple of tender acoustic ballads and the long jag of bluesy and punky numbers that closed the hourlong set. but a three-song encore grabbed it back. it included bugg’s strong rendition of neil young's “my my, hey hey,” during which he delivered the line “rock ’n’ roll can never die” as if it were still feasible.

fronting a black-clad five-piece band, albert hammond jr., of the strokes, preceded bugg with cliché-tinged songs and a smug indifference that showed why the claim was ever in doubt."

virgin mobile offers the best smartphone plan i’ve ever seen…by a long shot. if you pay the full price ($249) for a cheaper samsung intercept phone, you can jump on virgin mobile’s $25/month everything pre-paid with 300 anytime minutes. the plan comes with unlimited messaging, email & web.

yep, that’s it. finding a smartphone plan under $70/month is difficult, $25/month is unheard of.

for someone who doesn’t use their phone to talk a lot but wants a genuine smartphone, this blows away any featurephone out there.

speaking to virgin representatives, i can verify this is the real deal. my main concern was that after spending $250 on the phone, could virgin up the monthly price in the new year? they told me that there would be a grandfather clause where you’d continue to be billed at the rate you bought the phone at (but i’d prefer to have that in writing). i was also told that this is the only android phone that they’d carry in 2010, but more would likely be on the way, including an android 2.2-updated intercept some time in 2011.

if you want more talk minutes virgin does 1200 minutes for $40 and unlimited for $60.

the samsung intercept is by no means on the high end of android devices available today. in fact, virgin mobile generally pulls its phones from the low end of parent company sprint’s offering. but it is a working android 2.1 phone with gps and most of the midrange features you’ll find from other carriers and manufacturers. the screen at 3.2 inches and 240×400 pixels is probably the biggest limitation. but certainly not a dealbreaker at $25/month. i’m thinking this makes a great entry level smartphone for the kids or the folks who are featurephone hold outs.

it has gps hardware for navigation with google maps, bluetooth 2.1 for speakerphones and microsd card for expandability of up to 32gb.

i talked to sprint’s pre-paid group who mentioned that you can’t simply bring another sprint s android device to virgin and expect to get it activated. the reps i spoke to didn’t rule it out for the future but there are no current plans to do this.

you also can’t tether or use this device as a hotspot (without rooting it i’d assume). sprint said an android 2.2 update was in the works which may let you tether for something closer to their (also amazing ) $40/month plan.

sprint announced today at its quarterly earnings call, that they are picking up customers at a rate higher than anytime in recent memory and a lot of that has to do with its android and pre-paid customers. with deals like this, i only expect sprint to continue to gain marketshare.

the ranking is determined by a formula in which each game is analyzed as to who won and lost, by what margin and how strong the teams were according to their past performances. further, recent games a team has played carry more weight than earlier results.

this week's ranking was based on results of four previous games forea ch team, which accounted for 97 percent of the team's rating, and, to only a slight extent, results of exhibition games, which were wo rth 3 percent.

the times began its ratings last season, at the end of which the dolphins, with a record of 8-8, were ranked 18th. upward movement comes with difficulty in the league, so the dolphin climb is a tribute to coach don shula's young team, which takes on the jets sunday in miami.

one reason miami is ranked higher than the other unbeaten teams is that it played opponents with a better overall record. of five teams with 3-1 records, the san diego chargers are ranked highest, partly because of the strength of their opposition.

the giants, 2-2, are 17th, an advance of 10 places over their standing at the end of last season. the jets, 1-3, are 20th, moving up from 22d.

at the end of last season and before the playoffs, the atlanta falcons, who had won 12 of 16 regular-season games, finished at the top of the ranking, followed by the los angeles rams, the cowboys and the eagles.

the oakland raiders, who went on to win the super bowl, the first wild-card team to do so, were ranked fifth. now, off to a slow start, with five of their super bowl starters on the injured list, they are 13th.

the new york times pro football ranking is based on an analysis of each teams' scores with emphasis on three factors: who won a game, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. distinctions were also made as to the success of the offensive and defensive units. the quality of a team is determined by examining its performance against each of its opponents, and by then examining these opponents' other foes. the times's computer model collapses runaway scores to reduce the effect of any one game on the total ranking.

the results of recent games count more than earlier games in determining the ranking. account has also been taken of the home field advantage based on the average performance of road te ams this season.

the top-ranked team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to the top team. thus the ratings indicate how close a team may be to those ranked above it or below it. * the victories and losses of any given team have been deducted from its opponents' composite record. hence miami's opponents' record is based on the opponents' performance against all rivals except miami."
"san salvador, march 4— president jose napoleon duarte of el salvador said today that no ''preparations'' had been made for negotiations with the leaders of the leftist guerrillas. the concern over a coup was raised yesterday when roberto d'aubuisson, a former army intelligence major who still commands the loyalty of a number of right-wing officers, denounced any negotiations between the governing junta and the leftist guerrillas and strongly hinted that a coup might be attempted this month. backing for regime voiced

sources close to the president said that a trip to west germany he had planned for the weekend had been canceled, apparently out of fear of a right-wing coup.

at the same time, the united states embassy issued a statement opposing any attempt at a coup. the comment came after the embassy was the target of shots fired from a passing truck.

no one was injured by the burst of five or six shots, but frederic l. chapin, the american charge d'affaires, drew a connection between the shooting and the fears of a coup, saying that the united states had ''no intention of being intimidated.''

in a sign of support for president duarte, secretary of state alexander m. haig jr. said today that a right-wing coup would have ''serious consequences'' for continued united states aid to el salvador and that a call for mr. duarte's ouster ''does not represent united states policy in any way.'' (page a9.)

the concern over a coup was raised yesterday when roberto d'aubuisson, a former army intelligence major who still commands the loyalty of a number of right-wing officers, denounced any negotiations between the governing junta and the leftist guerrillas and strongly hinted that a coup might be attempted this month. backing for regime voiced

the statement read by mr. chapin said that while there was no proof, the attack on embassy had the ''hallmarks of a d'aubuisson operation'' and added, ''the united states government supports president duarte and his government and we oppose a coup and anyone who seeks to change the duarte government.''

the reagan administration has until now focused its concern on what it says is international communist aid to the guerrillas and has appeared to avoid involvement in internal politics. at a news conference yesterday, mr. d'aubuisson said that he had the impression that the administration would not oppose a military takeover.

fifty years of right-wing dictatorships in el salvador ended 17 months ago when reform-minded officers staged their own coup. they have since joined with mr. duarte and his christian democratic party in trying to find a middle ground between the two political extremes and to institute economic changes such as land redistribution to aid peasants. they have promised elections for next year.

in his statement, mr. chapin said: ''we support the government of el salvador in its move to implement existing reforms. and we further fully support the processes leading to elections for a constituent assembly and full national elections.''

nonetheless, mr. chapin said the primary threat remained the war waged by marxist guerrillas and not a coup from the right. in suggesting that mr. d'aubuisson might be behind the attack on the embassy, mr. chapin noted that an apparently identical truck had been used in a similar attack last may when mr. d'aubuisson was under arrest. arrest of rightist asked

at a news conference today, mr. duarte called for the arrest of mr. d'aubuisson, saying that his remarks yesterday were ''practically a call for a coup.''

mr. d'aubuisson was arrested in may for an attempted coup but was released shortly afterwards for supposed lack of evidence. he has since moved secretly back and forth between guatemala and el salvador, though there had been no formal call for his arrest until today.

arresting him would be a ticklish matter. most of the the military high command supports the junta, but many younger officers are reportedly supporters of mr. d'aubuisson.

american officials have charged that he is in the service of wealthy right-wing families, many of them now in miami, who have been economically undercut by the junta's changes. bullet enters embassy

today's shooting occurred at about 11 a.m., when a gray pickup truck with four men in the double cab came around a landscaped traffic circle at a corner of the embassy. witnesses reported hearing both automatic and semiautomatic fire from one or two guns.

salvadoran national guard troops guarding the embassy said they threw themselves to the ground as the bullets struck the metal picket fence surrounding the modernistic embassy and punctured a metal lamppost. one bullet entered the ground-floor cashier's office in the embassy.

no fire was returned and the truck continued around the circle and left. mr. chapin, in private meetings since his arrival, has been urging military and business leaders to back the junta. western sources said the attack appeared to be an attempt to intimidate embassy personnel and keep them from blocking a coup.

mr. duarte was careful today not to rule out a future trip to europe, saying, ''up to this moment i have not made any decision.'' he said he had been invited to attend the conference of union of world christian democrats now under way in brussels. he said he received a second invitation to attend a follow-up conference of west german christian democrats in bonn this weekend, and that the german foreign ministry had invited him to make an official visit.

''i cannot go at this moment,'' he said, ''unless it would be absolutely necessary.''

"a yearlong study by the community service society of new york has concluded that the problem of homeless people on the streets of the city has ''reached such extraordinary proportions'' that emergency housing must be set up. the study, to be made public tomorrow, says government agencies have failed to face the problem of the homeless and have made it even worse with the state's program of discharging many patients from mental institutions into communities. asked to comment on the study's findings, robert trobe, the deputy administrator for family and adult services of the city's human resources administration, said the city had only so much money for the homeless - spending about $12 million a year to shelter them. they think there is no end to revenues.'' report rebuts 'myth'

''counter to the prevailing myth that the homeless choose their nomadic lifestyle and refuse any assistance offered them,'' the report says, ''the reality is that most have never been offered the fundamental provisions of decent food and humane, noncoercive shelter.'' the researchers said some of the homeless had been forced violently from their hotels. in some cases, they said, buildings had been burned down to drive out tenants.","a yearlong study by the community service society of new york has concluded that the problem of homeless people on the streets of the city has ''reached such extraordinary proportions'' that emergency housing must be set up.

the study, to be made public tomorrow, says government agencies have failed to face the problem of the homeless and have made it even worse with the state's program of discharging many patients from mental institutions into communities.

the homeless are found in almost every part of the city. sometimes they are seen shuffling along the streets or crouched in doorways seeking temporary shelter from wind and rain. they inhabit the bus and railroad stations and subways until they are chased away by the police.

but many of the homeless are all but invisible, hidden in steam tunnels that snake under the streets or out of sight in cardboard boxes and packing cases that look like refuse waiting for the next garbage collection.

in all, there are an estimated 36,000 homeless men and women on the streets of new york city - a ''shocking statistic,'' the report says, especially when there are only 3,200 beds available in public shelters.

''on all accounts it falls woefully short,'' the report says of the city's capacity for sheltering the homeless. ''armories, unused hospitals, school buildings, hotels, theaters, in rem buildings, church basements, virtually anything with a roof and wall,'' the report says, ''could be used to accommodate homeless people at low cost and in short order.'' in rem buildings are ones that have been taken over by the city because the landlords did not pay taxes.

asked to comment on the study's findings, robert trobe, the deputy administrator for family and adult services of the city's human resources administration, said the city had only so much money for the homeless - spending about $12 million a year to shelter them.

''advocacy groups do not think there is any limit on the amount of money government can spend,'' he said. ''they think there is no end to revenues.''

mr. trobe defended the city's services for the homeless, saying that no one who turns up at a shelter is turned away. ''there are some people who choose not to come to the shelters,'' he said.

but the report of the community service society - a 132-year old nonprofit, nonsectarian social agency in manhattan - disagrees with the idea that the homeless prefer the streets. report rebuts 'myth'

''counter to the prevailing myth that the homeless choose their nomadic lifestyle and refuse any assistance offered them,'' the report says, ''the reality is that most have never been offered the fundamental provisions of decent food and humane, noncoercive shelter.''

the report, ''private lives/ public spaces: homeless adults on the streets of new york city,'' was the result of hundreds of interviews by two researchers, ellen baxter and kim hopper, who sought out the homeless all over the city, finding a widely varied group.

''a tattered appearance, bizarre behavior, belongings carried in plastic bags or cardboard boxes tied with string, swollen ulcerated legs or apparrent aimlessness: these are the obvious features which distinguish the homeless from other pedestrians and travelers,'' the 129-page report says.

''but there are also those who have been able to maintain a reasonably good personal appearance and whose behavior displays no apparent sign of disorder, and they are often overlooked by casual observation.''

the report explains how the researchers found homeless people who did not fit the usual description: ''their presence during late night hours when commuters have gone home and stores have closed, and especially their repeated presence in the same sites days or weeks later, is the only telling sign. after midnight, a prime time for research, the homeless become the majority in the waiting rooms of stations and terminals.'' 'no place to go nights'

the study gives examples of some of the homeless who do not fit the usual image. one was at a subway station: ''an impeccably dressed, small-framed woman in her late 60's stood quietly in the entranceway at 2 a.m. with her hands folded, because she 'had no place to go nights.' she said she had had such bad luck and that with rents so high, she couldn't afford both a place to stay and food to eat. she picks up a social security check at the bank each month, but it is barely enough to get by on.''

the report says that mental patients released from hospitals under a state program that seeks to ease them into communities constitute another part of the problem. and the ranks of the homeless are also swelled, according to the report, by the current high unemployment and evictions from single-room-occupancy hotels that are being upgraded by landlords into more profitable luxury housing.

the researchers said some of the homeless had been forced violently from their hotels. in some cases, they said, buildings had been burned down to drive out tenants. in others, they were told that developers had come in with sawed-off shotguns and dogs in the middle of the night to get people out. poignant scene at garbage can"
"bonn at the economic summit meeting of western leaders here in 1978, west germany staunchly resisted calls for it to use its head of economic steam like a locomotive to tug europe's lagging economies out of the recession that the oil crisis of 1974 had induced. growth in the first quarter was an acceptable 2 percent. but some of these measures had only partial success, and others brought unwanted side effects. by year end, the mark's relatively low value was making imports more costly, lifting the inflationary spiral in germany again, but doing little to stem the decline in exports caused by worldwide recession. as the year ended, the outlook for 1981 offered little consolation. in october, bonn's minister of economics, otto lambsdorff, predicted economic growth in 1981 would be between zero and 1 percent. schmidt rejected what he belittlingly termed the ''rhetoric of belt-tightening.''","bonn at the economic summit meeting of western leaders here in 1978, west germany staunchly resisted calls for it to use its head of economic steam like a locomotive to tug europe's lagging economies out of the recession that the oil crisis of 1974 had induced.

by the end of 1980, however, germany's politicians and industrialists would have been flattered if anyone had asked them to play locomotive. with the cost of oil still climbing and europe's economies locked in another downturn, west germany, too, had run out of steam and its leaders were becoming increasingly pessimistic about 1981.

most people remain convinced that germany is still one of the line's heavier pieces of rolling stock, but they also have came to realize that it is not immune to the economic difficulties that plague other industrialized nations.

to be sure, 1980 began well for west germany. fears of spiraling oil prices led factory owners to stockpile, industry booked heavy orders, and assembly lines hummed. growth in the first quarter was an acceptable 2 percent.

in the second quarter, however, the pace slackened. consumer spending eased as energy costs rose. orders from overseas dried up as developing countries spent their money for oil rather than for turnkey plants from west germany. production slowed further when ripples of the united states recession, which had begun earlier in the year when interest rates were screwed ever higher to fight inflation, spread across the atlantic. but that was only half the picture.

traditionally, germany is a juggler of its current account, using strong export earnings to offset the capital german companies invest abroad, the money german tourists spend overseas, and the considerable sums foreign workers send back to families in places like turkey and yugoslavia.

but in 1980, a combination of slackened exports, sharply increased payments for imports - among other things, for costly oil - enormous outlays by german tourists abroad, and huge overseas industrial investment swelled the deficit to $14.2 billion, after a $5.4 billion deficit in 1979, and reduced the current account to a shambles. in 1978, the current account had showed a surplus of nearly $9 billion; it is expected to be $10 billion in deficit this year.

germany's economic engineers at the central bank, the bundesbank, did their best to attract capital back into germany by raising their key lending rates to record heights. and last spring, the government went borrowing from saudi arabia to further close the gap.

but some of these measures had only partial success, and others brought unwanted side effects. the high interest rates lost much of their attraction because they came at a time when the united states, to fight double-digit inflation, also lifted interest rates to alltime highs. in addition, they made money expensive, dampening the economy further at a time when many said cheap money was needed to stoke the fires.

what is more, the high united states interest rates that attracted investors out of german marks and into dollars caused the mark to drop in value by 15 percent compared with the dollar last year. by year end, the mark's relatively low value was making imports more costly, lifting the inflationary spiral in germany again, but doing little to stem the decline in exports caused by worldwide recession.

as the year ended, the outlook for 1981 offered little consolation. in october, bonn's minister of economics, otto lambsdorff, predicted economic growth in 1981 would be between zero and 1 percent. shortly thereafter, in a gloomy joint report, germany's five leding economic institutes said they expected the country's real gross national product to stand still in 1981, after 2 percent growth in 1980.

but by the beginning of the new year, even these somber predictions were considered too optimistic. in an address to the nation, chancellor helmut schmidt warned that ''1981 is a hard piece of road lying ahead of us.'' his remarks were likely prompted by predictions by some economists who were saying that economic activity could shrink by as much as 1.5 percent over the year.

and in a survey, economists at the commerzbank, the country's third-largest commercial bank, said consumer buying was likely to stagnate in 1981, as tax cuts promised by the government for early in the year are offset by rising social security payments.

government pump-priming will be out of the question, the survey said, and unemployment will go up to about 4.8 percent. more important, the number of people on shortened hours, now 130,000, should jump to 520,000, the bank economists said.

in his speech, mr. schmidt rejected what he belittlingly termed the ''rhetoric of belt-tightening.'' and when a junior minister in his government, andreas von bulow, minister of research, told reporters later that the government might have to consider limiting travel and currency expenditures abroad if the high deficit proves to be a chronic ailment, he was immediately called to order by his senior colleagues.

mr. harnick, the lyricist for ''fiddler on the roof,'' reports that he and mr. raposo have been working on ''it's a wonderful life'' for nearly two years, but not solidly. ''in the midst of it,'' he says, ''i got an assignment from the houston grand opera to do 'carmen.' it opened last january. and joe did the score for 'the great muppet caper' movie.''

mr. harnick has also been working on another new musical, ''a christmas carol,'' which will open in wilmington, del., in november with richard kiley as scrooge. after that, he and mr. raposo will give their full attention to ''it's a wonderful life.'' theoretically, mr. harnick could have two shows on broadway next season, for ''a christmas carol'' is scheduled to tour the country for a year and then open in new york.

bob gunton, the original juan peron in ''evita,'' is coming back to new york in amlin gray's ''how i got that story,'' which deals with the vietnam war. last season mr. gunton gave a tour de force performance in it, playing 21 different roles in an off off broadway production at the second stage. don scardino will also be in the obie award-winning play, which has a cast of two. harold defelice and louis scheeder, the producers, plan to open ''how i got that story'' off broadway in early december. carole rothman, co-artistic director of the second stage, will again direct the play.

mr. scardino is now in previews with jeffrey moss's new musical ''double feature,'' due to open on oct. 8 in the theater at st. peter's. but according to miss rothman, mr. scardino went into that show with the und erstanding that he could leave to do ''how i got that story.''

and now he is producing mr. hwang's third play, ''family devotions,'' a comedy about a chinese communist who visits his rich relatives in the posh bel air section of los angeles. robert allan ackerman is directing the production. performances begin on oct. 6.

mr. papp and mr. ackerman had trouble casting ''family devotions'' in new york and found seven of their nine actors in los angeles. ''there are not enough good asian actors here,'' mr. papp says. ''parts are not written for them. they have so little opportunity to act.''

jill o'hara says she is amazed by the timing of all this: she used to be a meek person who sat by herself and never opened her mouth at meetings of her tenants' association. then, a year ago, she suddenly became the feisty ringleader of a hard-fought rent strike. and now, as the leader of a women's assertiveness training group in barbara schottenfeld's musical ''i can't keep running in place,'' miss o'hara is encouraging other women to stand up for themselves.

''the whole idea of fighting for your rights, and not being intimidated by the big boys. the first lawyers i talked to said we didn't have a case. then i got the name of leonard lerner, a lawyer who specializes in tenants' rights. i call him the legal eagle. the landlord settled with us for $27,000 out of court. what i have learned from that experience!''

miss o'hara went into ''i can't keep running in place'' at the westside arts theater three weeks ago as marcia rodd's replacement. ''when i first heard about the role, i didn't think i'd like it,'' she says. ''i don't think the theater should be used to exploit political causes. so often you end up with a pamphlet on the stage instead of the human condition. but then i went to see the show, and was rocked by it. i didn't expect something that would move me so.''

she adds that she is surprised by the numbers of people who come up to her after the show to tell her how much they enjoyed her performance in the neil simon-burt bacharach musical ''promises, promises.'' that was in 1968, and miss o'hara was the toast of new york in her first - and only - starring role on broadway. previously she had been leading lady of the original production of ''hair'' at the public theater.

''i was only 21 in 'promises,' '' miss o'hara says. ''people forget how young i was. i've done everything backward in my career.'' since ''promises,'' she has worked mostly in regional theaters and summer stock. ''i've done several broadway-bound shows th at folded and didn't come in,'' she notes. ''there is a lot of luc k in this business. actually, i hate show business, but i love my work. there are a lot of bad people in this business.

''did you know that the song 'i'll never fall in love again' from 'promises' was written for me? burt bacharach wanted to record it with me. my manager said no. i didn't know at the time that my manager was starting his own record company and wanted me to record the song for him. eventually, he went bankrupt. dionne warwick recorded the song. i have a few other stories like that, unfortunately.''

suddenly, miss o'hara's frown turns into a big smile. ''i have a very rich personal life,'' she reports. ''i'm engaged to philip jones, a painter, and i've never been happier.'

tonight ''evita'' begins its third year at the broadway theater. the cast is currently headed by derin altay as eva peron, james stein as che guevera and david cryer as juan peron. ... casting notes from the manhattan theater club: cleavon little will make a rare new york stage appearance as the star of oyama's new play, ''the resurrection of lady lester.'' he will portray lester young, the jazz saxophonist. and alvin epstein has been signed to star in alonso alegria's new play ''crossing niagara.'' both productions begin performances on oct. 20. ... christopher durang's one-act comedies, ''sister mary ignatius explains it all for you'' and ''the actor's nightmare,'' will open on oct. 22 at playwrights horizons. elizabeth franz, polly draper, robert joy, timothy landfield, mark stefan and mary catherine wright will head the casts, and jerry zaks will direct. ... richard horner has been named booking agent for a coalition of theaters on west 42d street's theater row. the theaters are seeking to book outside attractions during their dark periods to generate much-needed income.

"east rutherford youngsters squealed with laughter as the first contingent of clowns chased each other in mock fury to the accompaniment of the circus band. we couldn't ask for a better place to stage a circus,'' said tim holst, the performance director. '' while clowns were entertaining in the recently opened arena, animal attendants backstage were preparing elephants for the next act. holst became performance director of the red unit of the circus, which made him responsible for everything that happens out on the floor. ''it's a big job,'' he said, ''not only because of the technical problems involved in setting up each date and performance, but also in controlling squabbles that often arise from time to time between performers. artists, stagehands and animal keepers - more than 300 travel with the circus from city to city - were nearly unanimous in their praise of the new arena and said they hoped the new jersey engagement would become an annual event. ''performers even get their own dressing rooms. we left the house a half-hour ago, bought tickets and even had time to buy popcorn for the kids before the first act.","east rutherford youngsters squealed with laughter as the first contingent of clowns chased each other in mock fury to the accompaniment of the circus band. minutes later, they sat in awe as the full circus cast took center stage.

this was the 111th edition of the ringling brothers and barnum & bailey circus and it was the first time the circus had given regularly scheduled performances in new jersey. the run, at the brendan t. byrne arena here, will end tuesday.

according to circus organizers, performers and spectators alike, the engagement is one they would like to see continued. ''we couldn't ask for a better place to stage a circus,'' said tim holst, the performance director. ''our people love it.'' while clowns were entertaining in the recently opened arena, animal attendants backstage were preparing elephants for the next act.

''it's constant motion back here,'' said mr. holst, as several showgirls climbed atop the elephants and steadied themselves. within moments, spotlights illuminated the entrance as the elephants, trunk to tail, lumbered into the arena.

although the dream of becoming a circus performer usually begins at a young age, mr. holst was a year out of college before he left a teaching job in idaho and enrolled at the then newly opened clown college in venice, fla., in 1972.

''it was a flamboyant fantasy,'' mr. holst recalled. ''i was young, single and with no obligations. in short, i was having the time of my life, but the thing i really wanted was to become the singing ringmaster.''

he realized that ambition the following year, and served as ringmaster for five years while gaining experience in dealing with the people and personalities that shape the circus.

in 1978, mr. holst became performance director of the red unit of the circus, which made him responsible for everything that happens out on the floor.

''it's a big job,'' he said, ''not only because of the technical problems involved in setting up each date and performance, but also in controlling squabbles that often arise from time to time between performers. my biggest headache right now is a fear of someone getting hurt, since everyone is dead tired at this stage of the season.''

because of the large number of performers, stagehands and others, ringling brothers divides the circus into two divisions, the red and blue units. each is a different troupe, and they alternate routes and cities during the season.

logging nearly 1,000 performances in more than 40 cities since the middle of january, the performers will get a few weeks off after their next engagement at the nassau county veterans memorial coliseum in uniondale, l.i.

shortly after the first of the year, they will rejoin the circus at its winter headquarters in florida. ''it's hard work and we're all exhausted,'' said wally naghtin, ''but let's face it. it has to be one of the most exciting occupations in the world,''

together with his wife, 14-year-old son and two assistants, mr. naghtin presides over 14 bears who ride bicycles and motorcycles. ''as long as the bears hold up, i think we'll make it,'' mr. naghtin said. artists, stagehands and animal keepers - more than 300 travel with the circus from city to city - were nearly unanimous in their praise of the new arena and said they hoped the new jersey engagement would become an annual event.

''it seems that every new facility we play in is a little better than the next,'' mr. holst said, ''but this one seems to have the best of everything. the backstage area is spotless, and there is plenty of room for the animals, cars trucks and props right here in the building.

''performers even get their own dressing rooms. that's quite a treat for many not used to such privacy in other arenas.'' although the red unit is performing for the second time this year in the new york area - the same group appeared at madison square garden in new york city last spring - circus officials are pleased with attendance at the byrne arena so far and expect an even better response when state residents realize they can see the circus without going to new york.

enthusiasm here was not limited to the performers. ''i can't believe it,'' said andrew hilton of teaneck, who went with his wife and two children. ''we left the house a half-hour ago, bought tickets and even had time to buy popcorn for the kids before the first act.

''i'll tell you one thing: this beats going to new york city for the circus by a country mile.''

you could say that thomas boswell's ''how life imitates the world series'' is an obvious sort of baseball book because its pieces answer many of the questions that seem obvious to anyone who follows the game closely. why do the baltimore orioles win more games than any other team? (short answer: they have earl weaver to manage them.) why did bill veeck used to consume four packs of cigarettes and a case of beer a day? (with oscar wilde, he believed that ''the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.'')

what's the point of going to the ballpark early enough to watch both teams take batting practice? (''it is commonplace, but essential, to note that the longest home runs, the best outfield catches, the grandest infield pirouettes are almost always displayed in batting practice. the fresh memory of those harshly batted balls and brilliant catches keeps us aware of the potential behind each pitch during the actual game. surely the gent who reached the upper deck at 6 p.m. can still do it at 10 p.m.'') how prevalent are spitball pitchers nowadays? (very.)

mr. boswell, who writes for the washington post and is a contributing editor of inside sports, may not get off the cleverest or most graceful lines in the world. though i loved his evocation of earl weaver sitting on a stool in his office and cursing all ''the reporters cowering over him,'' i winced at the description of reggie jackson as ''the hester prynne of sluggers who walks through the baseball world with a scarlet dollar sign on his chest,'' especially when it became the only line in this entire collection to be repeated.

and if, as an undergraduate at amherst, you happen to have beaten david eisenhower for the college stickball championship, you are obliged to come up with a better punch line than ''i always said you couldn't learn real stickball on the south lawn.''

nor is mr. boswell altogether charming on the transcendental meaning of baseball: ''in our daily cacophony, the national 'pastime' is one of those notes we periodically strike in hopes of hearing a hint of middle c.'' anyway, when it comes to celebrating the game's radiance, roger angell has pretty much retired the trophy.

but mr. boswell has good ideas for subjects: what baseball is like in such places as puerto rico and cuba. why sandy koufax retired at the peak of his career and why he came back after 13 years of wandering, to help coach dodger spring training. what made bill veeck such a maverick among team owners.

better yet: he comes up with any number of entertainingly original approaches to a story: recount the 1980 pennant races backwards from the moment pete rose caught that flubbed pop-up to save the championship for the philadelphia phillies. list and track down the members of the starting lineup of the last washington senators team ever to open the season in the nation's capital. follow the career of a beginner with the bluefield (va.) orioles all the way to however far he gets in professional baseball.

best of all, mr. boswell catches a lot of details that make things clearer than they were before. did you know that it may have been a ''hanging spitter'' that the yankees' bucky dent hit off boston's mike torrez to win the 1978 american league east playoff game, which mr. boswell pronounces ''the greatest game ever played''? is there a better way to sum up little league baseball than mr. boswell's description of two husbands having to separate their scrapping wives? might bill veeck not best be described as ''the man in chicago who danced with his wife,'' his beloved counselor and helpmeet, mary frances?

among mr. boswell's sharpest insights may be his discovery of a new baseball statistic, the total average. this is the ratio between the total number of bases a player accumulates for his team by any means, be it walking, stealing or hitting a home run, and the outs he costs his club at bat or on the base paths. as mr. boswell points out, total average makes it possible to create a single scale on which a slugger like reggie jackson (1980 total average, 1.065) may be compared with a rabbit like ricky henderson (1980 total average, 1.034). ''it illuminates new stars like henderson and willie randolph, while blowing holes in big names like steve garvey and pete rose.''

best of all, it shows that on the all-time list, where babe ruth (1.432), ted williams (1.369) and lou gehrig (1.255) rank first, second and third, mickey mantle is a surprising sixth (1.115), while willie mays is 13th (1.019) and duke snider is 23d (0.972). this ought to settle one long-simmering hot-stove-league debate.

actually, i'm only kidding, or indulging a rooting bias. total average doesn't account for fielding skill or even ability to hit in the clutch. all the same, it's an interesting statistic. it suggests that johnny mize, joe jackson and hack wilson, each of whom ranks in the all-time top 20, are underrated. it suggests that dave kingman is given more than his due.

lb wilhoite signs one-year deal to stay with 49ers

niners inside linebacker michael wilhoite, a restricted free agent, has signed his one-year qualifying offer from the team and will aim to assume a starting role for the third straight season.

the move wasn’t a surprise: wilhoite was participating in the offseason program before signing the deal.

wilhoite, 29, had 85 tackles and one interception in 12 starts last year before he was sidelined with a season-ending ankle injury.

last year, wilhoite replaced retired patrick willis and played alongside navorro bowman. in 2014, when bowman was sidelined with a knee injury, wilhoite replaced him and had 87 tackles and two interceptions.

in 2016, wilhoite figures to compete with gerald hodges for a starting role. in october, the 49ers traded a sixth-round pick and center nick easton to the vikings for hodges, who had 39 tackles in four starts after wilhoite was injured. hodges is in the final year of his contract.

the 49ers did not select an inside linebacker any of their 11 draft picks. on saturday, general manager trent baalke was asked why he didn’t address the position, which was weakened when willis and chris borland retired last year.

“who said it was the top need on the team?” baalke said. “i would respectfully disagree, but we feel good about that group. we really do. we weren’t in a position at any point where we felt the player available was that guy. we feel real good about that room. we really do. we’re going to plug away.”"

the disclosure came as law enforcement authorities in bangladesh and elsewhere continued to investigate the february cyber theft of $81 million from a bangladesh bank account at the new york federal reserve bank. swift has acknowledged that the scheme involved altering swift software on the bank’s computers to hide evidence of fraudulent transfers.

“swift is aware of a number of recent cyber incidents in which malicious insiders or external attackers have managed to submit swift messages from financial institutions’ back-offices, pcs or workstations connected to their local interface to the swift network,” the group warned customers on monday in a notice seen by reuters.

get data sheet, fortune’s technology newsletter.

the warning, which swift issued in a confidential alert sent over its network on monday, did not name any victims or disclose the value of any losses from the previously undisclosed attacks. swift confirmed to reuters the authenticity of the notice.

also on monday, swift released a security update to the software that banks use to access its network.

swift issued that update to thwart malware that security researchers with british defense contractor bae systems said was probably used by hackers in the bangladesh bank heist.

bae’s evidence suggested that hackers manipulated swift’s alliance access server software, which banks use to interface with swift’s messaging platform, to cover their tracks.

bank hackers steal an estimated $300 million

bae said it could not explain how the fraudulent orders were created and pushed through the system.

but swift provided some evidence about how that happened in its note to customers, saying that in most cases the modus operandi was similar.

it said the attackers obtained valid credentials for operators authorized to create and approve swift messages, then submitted fraudulent messages by impersonating those people.

swift, or the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication, is a cooperative owned by 3,000 financial institutions. its messaging platform is used by 11,000 banks and other institutions around the world and is considered a linchpin of the global financial system.

swift spokeswoman natasha deteran told reuters that the commonality in these cases was that internal or external attackers compromised the banks’ own environments to obtain valid operator credentials.

“customers should do their utmost to protect against this,” she said in an email to reuters.

swift told customers that the security update must be installed by may 12.

“we have made the alliance interface software update mandatory as it is designed to help banks identify situations in which attackers have attempted to hide their traces—whether these actions have been executed manually or through malware,” she said."

"the answer is maybe -- but they can't do anything that you couldn't do yourself, for free. under the federal credit repair organizations act, credit repair companies need to provide a detailed written contract about the services they'll perform, include a three-day right to cancel without charge, state how long it will take to see results, disclose the total cost to you and outline any guarantees. all consumers are entitled to a free copy of their reports with the three major credit reporting bureaus (experian, equifax and transunion) every 12 months at www.annualcreditreport.com. send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. you may also request that they send the corrected version to anyone who received your report in the past six months (or two years for reports that went to prospective employers). some creditors are willing to look at your more recent credit history, so as long as you keep showing improvement, a past problem might not set you back.","the answer is maybe -- but they can't do anything that you couldn't do yourself, for free.

anything on your report that's bringing down your credit score is going to stay on, if it's accurate information.

so if a credit repair company promises to remove negative information such as a bankruptcy or judgment, and they want money up front to do it -- run. credit experts say that only time, effort and a solid plan for repaying your debts will improve your credit-worthiness.

there are plenty of unsavory operators out there, so be careful. many consumers have lost hundreds if not thousands of dollars to scammers who take their money and do nothing to improve their credit. here are some warning signs, according to the federal trade commission:

the company wants you to pay up front for credit repair service before they do any work.

they do not disclose your legal rights.

they recommend that you don't contact the credit bureau directly.

they advise you to take action that seems illegal, such as creating a new credit identity or disputing all the information in your credit report, even info that is correct. (you can be charged with mail or wire fraud if you apply for credit and give false information.)

under the federal credit repair organizations act, credit repair companies need to provide a detailed written contract about the services they'll perform, include a three-day right to cancel without charge, state how long it will take to see results, disclose the total cost to you and outline any guarantees. it's illegal for them to charge you up front.

before you hire anyone, remember this: the sad truth is that accurate negative information stays on your report for seven years. bankruptcies are reported for 10 years. criminal info can stay on forever.

no credit repair company can get rid of that.

if there's incorrect information on your report, however, that's another story – and you can fix that yourself. all consumers are entitled to a free copy of their reports with the three major credit reporting bureaus (experian, equifax and transunion) every 12 months at www.annualcreditreport.com. and if you've been denied credit, insurance or employment due to a lousy credit report within the last 30 days, you also are entitled to a free copy of your report.

look for mistakes or outdated items. you can dispute these for free through the credit reporting bureaus. explain why you're disputing it, provide copies of documents and request an investigation. tip: include a copy of the credit report with the questionable items circled. send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. the credit reporting bureau must investigate within 30 days. you also should contact the company that provided the inaccurate information so they can correct it.

if you win your dispute, the credit reporting bureau will have to correct your report. you may also request that they send the corrected version to anyone who received your report in the past six months (or two years for reports that went to prospective employers).

if you don't win, you can ask that your report includes a statement with your version of the dispute.

whatever the state of your credit report, don't lose heart. some creditors are willing to look at your more recent credit history, so as long as you keep showing improvement, a past problem might not set you back. if you're still struggling, consider using a non-profit credit counseling service to get back on track. if you go this route, ask your local consumer agency, financial institution, military base or other trusted source for a recommendation, or check out the national foundation for credit counseling, www.nfcc.org, the country's largest non-profit credit counseling service, with 90 member agencies nationwide.

"filing for unemployment benefits can be tricky. some states, such as california, at least try to make it easy with various ways to file. even if you accepted a buyout so that you wouldn't be laid off, it's still technically a layoff and you're entitled to unemployment benefits. this again shows that the job loss was out of your control and that the company chose to let you go as it restructured its workforce. the ultimate test, pugh said, is that a worker lost their job through no fault of their own. if you had good reason to quit, then you can collect unemployment. but you must have complained about the cause long before quitting

more articles you might like","filing for unemployment benefits can be tricky. if you're lucky and haven't lost your job before, it can be a difficult process to wade through the red tape. some states, such as california, at least try to make it easy with various ways to file.

but there's one area of the claim form that you don't want to mess up when filing, even though your head is probably still spinning from losing your job -- the reason for losing your job. you want to tell the truth, and there are some ""magic words,"" or keywords, to use so that an unemployment benefits claim isn't quickly rejected.

remember that each state sets its own laws on such things, so these suggested terms may not work everywhere.

if you lost your job through no fault of your own because the company is downsizing, then this is the term to use. even if you accepted a buyout so that you wouldn't be laid off, it's still technically a layoff and you're entitled to unemployment benefits.

this is basically the same as a layoff, and puts the burden of proof on the employer. go with what you were told by your employer when you lost your job, said jill pugh, an employment law attorney in seattle.

if you were fired but tell the unemployment department that you were laid off, you could be accused of fraud, which could result in penalties beyond paying back any unemployment benefits you've collected, pugh said. penalties could include being disqualified for future benefits the next time you apply, to a higher interest rate when paying back owed benefits.

this again shows that the job loss was out of your control and that the company chose to let you go as it restructured its workforce. saying that you got a buyout may not be the best way to word it, because some states consider that leaving your job at your choice, although most states allow workers who accept buyouts to collect unemployment if they were in fact laid off.

the ultimate test, pugh said, is that a worker lost their job through no fault of their own. if so, they should get benefits. employees can be fired and still collect benefits if they couldn't do the job and it wasn't their fault, pugh said. being unable to work a computer program, for example, could lead to being fired. but because the employee didn't do it willfully, they can still get benefits.

this puts the emphasis on the job itself instead of the person who lost their job.

this term replaces using ""quit,"" which should be avoided, pugh said. using ""quit"" implies it was your choice. if you had good reason to quit, then you can collect unemployment. good causes include taking a big pay cut of 25 percent, unsafe workplace, illegal behavior by others at work, sexual harassment at work, and failure to accommodate workers with disabilities. but you must have complained about the cause long before quitting

this is ok to use, pugh says, if you were fired for something that you didn't do wrong, such as steal from the company.

in california, if a claimant is discharged for misconduct connected with work, benefits may be denied, said pasadena lawyer melanie calvert, in an e-mail to aol jobs. ""misconduct means gross misconduct which harms the employer's business. ordinary negligence is not generally considered gross misconduct. if a california claimant was discharged or quit due to an 'irresistible' compulsion to use intoxicants, he or she may be denied benefits. on the other hand, a claimant may receive benefits if they quit due to unlawful job harassment.""

it's a difficult word to put on an unemployment application and one you want to avoid if possible, but it shouldn't stop you if you did nothing wrong. one huge trick of employers is to ask an employee to resign or be fired, with the implication that they'll still get benefits if they resign but won't if they're technically fired, pugh said. misconduct by the employee won't lead to unemployment benefits, so there's no sense in fighting it, but if you did nothing wrong, then you can still get fired and claim benefits.

""i wouldn't fall for it,"" she said of employers trying to entice people to quit. ""it's much, much harder to get benefits if you quit than if you were discharged.""

that's because the burden of proof for getting benefits is on the worker if they quit, and on the employer if discharged.

that's the phrase to keep in mind when applying for benefits if you quit while being threatened with termination, pugh said. even if the firing is justified, it could still be based on nothing bad on the employee's part. for example, if you violated a company rule you didn't know about, it wasn't an intentional bad act and you should still be able to collect benefits.

people worry about the stigma of getting fired and what it will look like to future employers. but if you didn't do anything wrong, it's nothing to hide from. only your employer who fired you can look at your unemployment claim, and potential employers are not allowed to look at it, pugh said.

""a lot of times people don't want to do that because it looks bad,"" she said of admitting being fired on an unemployment application.

applying for unemployment benefits is a right to people who have lost their jobs, and it can be a stigma for people who have never done it before. the good news is that the national recipiency rate -- the percentage of unemployed workers who collect benefits -- is dropping, from 45 percent in 2001 to 37 percent in 2008. that's more people claiming the benefits they're entitled to -- as long as a few words don't trip them up.

the movie, which opened last week and was no. 1 at the box office, is a bloody revenge epic and a homage to asian action movies.

mr. easterbrook criticized miramax, and its parent company, disney, as seeking profit by ''wallowing in gore'' with movies like ''scream'' and ''kill bill.''

he said, ''disney's c.e.o., michael eisner, is jewish; the chief of miramax, harvey weinstein, is jewish.''

''yes, there are plenty of christian and other hollywood executives who worship money above all else, promoting for profit the adulation of violence,'' mr. easterbrook said. ''does that make it right for jewish executives to worship money above all else, by promoting for profit the adulation of violence?''

mr. easterbrook went on to say, ''recent european history alone ought to cause jewish executives to experience second thoughts about glorifying the killing of the helpless as a fun lifestyle choice.''

the romantic age triggered reaction against pope's neo-classical techniques. homer was considered a bard, close to nature, betrayed by the high pomp of england's augustan age. but there has been a rejection of that rejection. the formulaic devices of homer served a highly ritualistic world, with typical scenes of strict protocol for sacrifice, prayer, combat, hospitality and oratory. pope's own formulas no longer look so un-homeric.

yet this great poem has not been available for use in classrooms, or in modest libraries, since the great twickenham edition of it is cruelly expensive. steven shankman, a professor of english and classics at the university of oregon, eugene, and director of the oregon humanities center, remedies that shameful neglect with a new pope's ''iliad'' (''the iliad of homer translated by alexander pope,'' penguin, $22.95), completely re-editing the poem from pope's last published edition (the twickenham works from the first edition), modernizing the spelling and - most important - including pope's extensive notes, which show how carefully pope weighed the possible meanings of the original.

the retention of pope's punctuation is less helpful than it might at first seem. though he was careful about it, he was working with 18th-century conventions and his audience's knowledge of the heroic couplet's possibilities. the modern reader will not readily perceive the degree of pause pope was indicating with the onward flow of his lines.

the thing that best distinguishes this from all other translations of homer is that it alone equals the original in its ceaseless pour of verbal music. when pope's contemporaries praised him for his ''numbers,'' they were referring not to the fairly obvious metrical system of the heroic couplet but to the euphony he achieved within its constraints. the relatively enclosed nature of the system concentrates attention on every syllable in the line, on continual shifts in the position and degree of pause marked by metrical breaks (caesuras), on sound effects used to emphasize the careful alterations in word order. dryden, working a generation earlier on his translation of virgil, had complained that the raspy consonants of english denied him the smooth vowel effects of the ancient languages. pope worked miracles in highlighting the play of vowels through his lines. his most potent effect is assonance - the lazy music, for instance, of the three long e sounds (ease, heaps, grieves) in this:

thus at full ease, in heaps of riches rolled,

the relatively full stop after ease sets the tone for its sound being repeated. by contrast, there is a plangent climax to the mounting long a sounds (mat-, race, -slaved) in

the matrons ravished, the whole race enslaved.

there is a lighter pause at that caesura, which is not preceded by the key sound, and a lighter stress on the words that follow. the vowel music often tells us how much or little weight to put on the metrical beats.

the echo of leap in greek makes us read the line this way:

leaped forth the lot of every greek desired.

the interplay of assonance (long e sounds) with double caesuras in the second line of this couplet shows how athena pulls achilles up short:

the force of keen reproaches let him feel,

but sheath, / obedient, / thy revenging steel.

the sputtering rage of achilles is marked by double caesuras and stammering short u sounds (-ious, thus, -rupt-) in this couplet's second line:

here on the monarch's speech achilles broke

and furious thus / and interrupting / spoke.

the sense here is underlined by consonants clashing at the word junctures (-ious-thus, -rupting-spoke). though pope de-emphasized english consonants when he wanted smoothness, he thickened them for obstructive effect. ajax's shield is tough

with sev'n thick folds o'ercast

when a spear hits that shield later on, it must drive through six bull hides

till in the sev'nth it fixed.

by omission of the vowel, consonants are crunched together.

here hector's chariot breaks through war's congestion (and consonants) to clear a space in the last five words:

and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.

here hector, plunging through the thickest fight

broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light.

when the meaning calls for it, pope can put as many as five caesuras in a couplet:

they tug, / they sweat, / but neither gain, / nor yield

one foot, / one inch / of the contended field.

or, conversely, he uses no caesura to get a spreading and leveling effect like this:

and one refulgent ruin levels all."

"cambridge — ask charlie kohlhase a question about jazz history. “i grew up at a time when people were really interested in free jazz. and i think you miss that today,” says charlie kohlhase. though his formal education didn’t extend beyond high school, the self-made musician complemented his copious listening habits with private instruction from saxophonist stan strickland and trombonist roswell rudd, plus the less-formal tutelage of the late john tchicai, a friend and sometime-collaborator who’d played sax with the likes of ayler and coltrane. with his explorer’s club, which kohlhase says he named with an eye toward something “with a boy scout-ish image but also the potential for some subversion,” he presents free-roaming compositions meant to highlight the musical ideas of his collaborators. ( depending on availability, the group may grow from three to nine players. that’s a clever way to run a band — to keep it fun like it’s a hang, but to get creative work done where everyone's contributing.” “i’m 100 percent sure he remembers what it was,” gershon says.","cambridge — ask charlie kohlhase a question about jazz history.

if you’re wondering about, say, an obscure studio session from the 1960s, there’s a good enough chance he’ll have a copy of it in his home collection, which numbers over 10,000 lps and a few thousand more cds.

and in a realm of music that was dividing itself into careful subgenres long before historians of edm debated the merits of chicago house music versus jump-up drum ’n’ bass, kohlhase will eagerly connect the dots between the seemingly incompatible styles of a mainstream icon and a fringe innovator.

“here’s somebody who understands that to define jazz by its stylistic limitations is artistically and creatively dangerous,” says guitarist eric hofbauer, who has played in kohlhase-led bands since 2000. “he loves louis armstrong as much as he loves albert ayler, and he can connect them both in four records. and he’s going to find a way in his original pieces to honor and justify both of those languages in the world of jazz.”

kohlhase—a saxophonist, songwriter, educator, and radio host who has led various free-jazz-minded ensembles in the area since 1980—achieved his stature as the boston area’s walking encyclopedia of jazz simply by listening to, and playing, lots of music. a native of portsmouth, n.h., he hung around the university of new hampshire for eight years, but not in the classrooms — he started djing on college radio while still a sophomore in high school.

outpost 186, 186 hampshire st., cambridge mass. 02139 http://www.outpost186.com

it was the record library of wunh that offered his first deep exposure to the music, spurred on by a few slightly older friends who talked up the merits of progressive players like john coltrane and the art ensemble of chicago. he quickly traded his pop-oriented show for two overnight on-air shifts, digging through the crates for the benefit of his listeners as many as 12 hours a week.

“i grew up at a time when people were really interested in free jazz. that was really part of the music to me. and i think you miss that today,” says charlie kohlhase.

“i got to listen to a lot of stuff,” kohlhase, who turns 57 this month, says with typical humility on the phone from his home in chelsea. the free-thinking musician, who later became an institution on mit’s wmbr-fm (88.1) — where he’s hosted the weekly show “research and development” since 1996 — has made it his business to promote “forward looking jazz,” as he calls it.

his long-running quintet, and succeeding ensembles ck5 and charlie kohlhase’s explorer’s club, have been forums for his creative compositions married with conscientiously orchestrated, but out-there, improvisation.

at the longy school of music in cambridge, he runs the student ensemble of the modern american music program, where he can call on his many friends and collaborators in boston’s free-blowing scene for fresh arrangements or compositions.

“i grew up at a time when people were really interested in free jazz. that was really part of the music to me. and i think you miss that today. i think the influence of wynton marsalis and jazz at lincoln center orchestra has kind of taken that music out of people's general perception of what jazz is,” he says. “to me, jazz is all of that. all the stuff — all the swing, bop, as well as free jazz — and we’re just trying to mold that into something that is a 21st-century music now.”

though his formal education didn’t extend beyond high school, the self-made musician complemented his copious listening habits with private instruction from saxophonist stan strickland and trombonist roswell rudd, plus the less-formal tutelage of the late john tchicai, a friend and sometime-collaborator who’d played sax with the likes of ayler and coltrane.

russ gershon, leader of the either/orchestra, which kohlhase has played with as a sideman for many years, says his friend’s catholic listening interests inform his playing but don’t cramp his creativity. “i know who his influences are and i hear them in his playing, but it’s just always charlie. he’s an open-minded, tolerant, very funny guy.”

with his explorer’s club, which kohlhase says he named with an eye toward something “with a boy scout-ish image but also the potential for some subversion,” he presents free-roaming compositions meant to highlight the musical ideas of his collaborators. (depending on availability, the group may grow from three to nine players. a trio version, with drummer curt newton and bassist matt stavrakas, plays outpost 186 on thursday.)

a section with relatively straight-ahead chord changes may give way to a more open modal improvisation, or a backbeat-driven vamp. players may even be assigned “roles” as the comic book-inspired characters kohlhase wryly created as thematic jumping-off points.

“the way i program the music with my band is kind of like a radio program. i try and get a variety of different sounds and textures into each set. and i think that kind of thing informs the writing and arranging as well,” he explains.the unifying spirit among kohlhase’s projects seems to be his general affability and openness to others’ musical suggestions.

“we always have a million ideas and we’re not afraid to say them, which is great. some bands i’m in, i keep my mouth shut. but it’s very comfortable in his band,” hofbauer says. at rehearsals, he adds, there’s plenty of laughter and personal catch-up time. “that’s a clever way to run a band — to keep it fun like it’s a hang, but to get creative work done where everyone's contributing.”

but beneath kohlhase’s unassuming nature is a busy mind.

gershon says he’s borrowed some things from kohlhase’s vast music library, but can name at least one item he hasn’t returned. surely his friend won’t miss it, right?

“i’m 100 percent sure he remembers what it was,” gershon says."

she became widely known with her first exhibition at the chisenhale gallery, in london in 1990, which consisted of one sculpture entitled ghosts. this was a white plaster cast of an entire room - eerily white and deserted. ""i wanted to give certain spaces an authority they'd never had,"" she said. she has since made works using casts of kitchen sinks, baths, beds, mattresses, floors and mortuary slabs. her bed pieces, cast in rubber, are clearly places of sexual encounter, birth and death.

born in 1961 in laos, he left his homeland at 11 to be educated in the west. the trauma of exile from laos and his family is the main inspiration of his art. strongly influenced by proust's a la recherche du temps perdu, his installations meditate on themes of separation, memory and transience of life. in just a moment in 1987, he projected snapshots of his family on to a white-sheeted bed and over it poured a stream of rice. he says that his work is ""based on nothing, no strict discourse, no rules except perhaps a new subjectivity . . . if there is an object, an aim, it is to start from a point and lead outwards"".

sean scully, nominated for the exhibitions of his recent work at waddington galleries, mary boone gallery and his retrospective at the modern art museum of fort worth, texas. born in dublin in 1954, scully is an abstract painter whose richly coloured works express strong emotions. in this sense he relates to rothko who used the rectangle as a non-objective form through which he could be, in scully's words, emotionally specific, using heightened colour to communicate feeling. he also speaks of creating a 'compressed experience' in which paint and image work together.

hannah collins, nominated for exhibitions at the third international istanbul biennial and at the centre d'art, santa monica, barcelona.

born in 1956, collins now lives and works in barcelona. she is a photographer involved with creating an experience of dramatically enhanced reality. she photographs a wide range of subject matter: landscapes, cityscapes, interiors, still lives and the figure. she favours black and white and prints her work on canvas. her best work is very strong and it is clear that although she attempts to create emotional drama, she is also drawn to the purely aesthetic potential of photography. 'i would say that my work is both sculptural and pictorial,' she says.

commenting on the shortlist, nicholas serota, director of the tate gallery and chairman of the jury, said: ""art in britain is being enriched by artists who bring experience of other cultures to this country.""

the members of this year's jury are: iwona blazwick (curator), carole conrad (collector and representative of patrons of new art), declan mcgonagle (director, irish museum of modern art, dublin), david sylvester (art historian) and nicholas serota. the winner of the £20,000 prize will be announced at the tate gallery on november 23."

they strut the streets of chinatown and flushing in packs, knives secreted in satin jackets, biceps tattooed with dragons.

the teen thugs call themselves ""a-e"" for american eagles or asian empire, and they mark a resurgence of organized chinese street gangs.

""this is the first new asian gang we've seen since all the heads of the flying dragons and ghost shadows went to jail,"" said one law enforcement source. ""these kids are mostly into gang assaults right now, but we know they are organizing and the larger gangs have an eye on them.""

the gang counts nearly 50 teenagers among its crew, an unusual merging of young immigrants from china's fujian province and abcs - american-born chinese. the immigrant gangsters speak to their american-born counterparts in fractured english.

since forming within the last year, they have staked out stretches of mulberry st. in chinatown and main st. in flushing, queens, gang experts said. so far they have largely targeted black and hispanic teens who trespass on their turf.

inspector william tartaglia, the commanding officer of the nypd's gang division, said his detectives have been monitoring the american eagles in recent months and said the gang is being kept in check.

""there have not been an alarming number of incidents involving them,"" tartaglia said. ""we have enough resources to track them and effectively deal with them.""

but the daily news has learned that the nypd is forming an asian-crime task force to deal with the gang and an influx of criminal activity in the immigrant chinese community.

the task force harks back to the jade squad, a joint nypd-manhattan district attorney's office probe of crime in chinatown that began in the 1980s.

this year alone, there has been a feud between rival bus companies that has sparked two murders and ongoing assaults.

and a dozen lawyers, restaurant owners and doctors with offices in chinatown have been the victims of violent push-in robberies in recent months.

although older gangs like the ghost shadows and flying dragons extorted merchants and set up mini-empires funded by prostitution and gambling in chinatown, the american eagles have begun to cut a violent swath outside lower manhattan.

on oct. 30, brothers eddie and omar donis were standing outside a duane reade drugstore in flushing when they were set upon by at least a dozen american eagles members who beat them with baseball bats before slashing them with knives and broken bottles, according to a criminal complaint.

""these kids are all over the neighborhood, the a-e's. there are a lot of stories about them,"" said eddie donis, 15, who was stabbed in the stomach and underwent surgery to remove part of his damaged intestines.

two teenagers were arrested in the attack on the donis brothers, who are hispanic. bin bin dong, 16, and zhong huang, 18, both of queens, were charged with gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon.

dong, who has a dragon tattoo on his arm, admitted membership in the american eagles, sources said.

dong is suspected in other attacks that police believe were racially motivated, including multiple beatings of a black teen, dennis hoffman, who said the american eagles shouted racial slurs at him during three separate attacks since march.

the most severe beating came sept. 23, when the gangsters cracked his skull, a wound that required doctors to staple his scalp back together.

us and international officials “made the recovery worse than it otherwise would have been,’’ dimon wrote in the letter released wednesday. they almost botched the us debt-ceiling vote, constrained bank leverage “at precisely the wrong time,’’ and adopted bad and uncoordinated policy, he wrote.

dimon, 56, defended a banking industry that has been besieged by new rules and public contempt after lax mortgage lending contributed to the worst economic slump since the great depression. he championed the use of derivatives and the right of banks to lobby lawmakers and hailed the us economy and corporations as engines of job growth.

“we have hundreds of rules, many of which are uncoordinated and inconsistent with each other,’’ dimon said in the 38-page letter, his longest since becoming chief executive in december 2005. “complexity and confusion should have been alleviated, not compounded.’’

dimon called a cap on debit card transaction fees, a provision of the dodd-frank act, “price-fixing by the government that will have the unfortunate consequence of leaving millions of americans unbanked.’’ stricter capital rules will make it “prohibitively more expensive’’ for banks to lend to consumers with subprime credit scores, about 40 percent of all americans, he said.

“jamie has taken on this mantle of defending this entire industry,’’ said michael driscoll, who worked for dimon as a trader at the smith barney brokerage and is now visiting professor at adelphi university in garden city, n.y. “he’s combative by nature. and like a lot of these alpha dogs, when he’s backed into a corner, he’s going to bark back.’’

still, dimon said he agreed with the intent of most of the financial reforms passed by congress. he said he supported giving regulators the authority to unwind failing firms and say on some executive compensation issues.

“but the result of the financial reform has not been intelligent design,’’ he wrote. “simplicity, clarity, and speed would be better for the system and better for the economy.’’

dimon said big businesses tend to not get enough credit for creating jobs in the united states.

“we often read that small business is the primary driver of new jobs - this is both incorrect and overly simplistic,’’ he wrote. large corporations generally are more stable and resilient in a recession and companies with more than 500 employees account for 51 percent of all jobs, he wrote.

most of the “bad actors’’ responsible for the financial crisis are gone, dimon said in the letter."

seated before her was an unusual crowd for this part of the city: more than 80 residential real estate brokers, all of whom had accepted the housing researcher’s invitation for a tour of the filene’s site and others around the district where new housing is planned.

“it was the first time so many residential brokers have come out to take a fresh look at this area,” said blair, president of link, a real estate information service. “we were totally shocked by the turnout.”

promised for years, the revitalization of the city’s long-struggling downtown is ­finally underway, with construction of residential towers transforming the largely commercial area into a full-blown neighborhood. the supply of housing is planned to double to more than 10,000 units in coming years, according to the boston redevelopment authority, and there is a sudden influx of retail shops and restaurants.

“there are so many deals going on, so many new people and businesses interested in downtown,” said randi lathrop, the bra’s deputy director of community planning. “every day i get a phone call about someone else who wants to open here.”

the construction of homes is particularly important to changing the neighborhood, as it will bring around-the-clock ­activity to streets that today feel desolate after the workday ends.

two residential towers are under construction and a third is planned at filene’s, where developers have won approval for a 625-foot apartment and condominium tower that will become a new marker on the downtown skyline.

meanwhile, mayor thomas m. menino’s administration is pumping millions of tax dollars into road and sidewalk repairs, new lighting, and other upgrades. those public works complement new investments by property owners, who recently received government approval­ to form a so-called business improvement district to provide better upkeep of the neighborhood. the major performance theaters have been modernized, and new technology tenants are bringing a younger workforce to the area.

the kensington, an apartment tower being constructed near where chinatown meets downtown crossing, will feature a pool, solarium, and yoga lounge.

lisa macalaster, a sales associate with coldwell banker residential brokerage, said that downtown is finally emerging as a viable housing alternative to boston’s other neighborhoods, where a shortage of available units is pushing buyers to look elsewhere.

“this feels like the next exciting rebirth of boston,” she said during the recent tour of the area. “there’s a lot of pent-up demand for housing right now.”

the downtown’s renaissance remains a work in progress, however. several streets are pockmarked with empty storefronts, and the area lacks a critical mass of modern shopping options. but five years after the big dig reshaped nearby streets, the next wave of improvements and construction is reaching into downtown’s side streets and pedestrian thoroughfares.

more than 600 housing units are under construction at the edge of what was once the combat zone.

across the street from the strip club centerfolds is the kensington, a 381-unit apartment tower that will feature an outdoor pool, solarium, and ­yoga lounge for young, affluent renters.

a block away on washington street, a 15-story residential building is rising across from the ritz carlton residences. the complex, known as millennium place, will include 256 luxury condominiums, a winetasting room, and outdoor gardens.

and soon to tower above them all is the filene’s project, on which construction is scheduled to begin next year. its developers have won approval for what would be the tallest residential building in boston.

estimated to cost $620 million, the project will add up to 600 housing units as well as offices and retail stores at the base of the tower and behind the facade of original 1912 filene’s building.

nearby, 59 temple place is being renovated as a 240-room boutique hotel, while hamilton co. is transforming an office building at 8 winter st. into 50 mid-priced apartments. even though construction is ongoing, 40 percent of the winter street units are rented.

harold brown, hamilton co.’s president, said that downtown has improved considerably since the mid-1990s, when menino first began trying to spruce it up.

“if the downtown is seven or eight now, it was a two back then,” he said.

city officials are hoping the wave of construction brings much-needed retail staples, such as a supermarket, as well as stores that don’t currently operate in the area.

among the retailers coming soon is walgreen co., which is opening an emporium next year at washington and school streets with an expansive natural foods section, a sushi bar, and a hair and nail salon.

pret a manger , the british prepared foods chain, recently opened an outlet at post office square.

the largest concentration of new retail space will be at the former site of filene’s, where at least 100,000 square feet will be added — enough for a supermarket and multiple restaurants and stores. a former barnes & noble bookstore is ­also available across the street, and the owners of lafayette city center are planning to convert part of the office complex into retail space.

during the recent real estate tour, several brokers said they are beginning to recommend that clients look for properties downtown. among the options is 45 province st. completed in 2009, the 137-unit tower initially struggled to attract buyers; today, 70 percent of its condominium units are sold or are under agreement.

“we’re finding a greater awareness of all the things going on in this part of the city,” said wayne lopez, the building’s sales director. “the downtown’s live-work dynamic is really starting to catch on.”"
"chris hansen, the arena investor who wants to bring the nba and nhl to town, says seattle is one of the best -- if not the best -- cities in the country in which to start up two more teams. the population is more affluent than the average, there are lots of nba fans and seattle is the 12th-biggest u.s. that ends up being arithmetically impossible."" but it should be noted that, these days, attendance is no longer the largest factor in a sport's team's financial success.

meanwhile, conway said, seattle's shipping industry is facing steeper competition from other ports and could be under threat by the widening of the panama canal. under the agreement, the city and county would contribute $200 million total, obtained via bonds, to the arena project if hansen can nail down both an nba and nhl team. the city's share is $120 million; the county's is $80 million. and the arena would still be capable of hosting professional hockey if seattle eventually got an nhl team. but beyers said it is still unknown how a new sports arena with two new teams would affect the economy of the entire region. nick eaton can be reached at 206-448-8125 or nickeaton@seattlepi.com. follow him on twitter at twitter.com/njeaton.","chris hansen, the arena investor who wants to bring the nba and nhl to town, says seattle is one of the best -- if not the best -- cities in the country in which to start up two more teams. the population is more affluent than the average, there are lots of nba fans and seattle is the 12th-biggest u.s. television market.

but an expert panelist for the king county council says seattle is actually the third-worst city in the country for adding two more teams.

""right now, given the teams that we have -- we have four right now, including the wnba -- we rank no. 8 in terms of what i call sports saturation,"" local economist dick conway told a council committee thursday. ""if we add two more teams, then we become the third worst-saturated city with regard to professional sports.

""you don't come up with seattle being the best place to put teams. that ends up being arithmetically impossible.""

as a member of the county council's arena review panel, conway conducted what he called an ""admittedly crude"" analysis comparing seattle to other u.s. cities with professional sports teams.

using the seahawks, mariners, sounders and storm, he took the potential total yearly attendance of these four teams and found that each of the region's 3.5 million residents would have to attend 1.7 games per year to fill 5.9 million seats.

by adding nba and nhl teams, seattle's potential sports attendance would jump to 7.4 million a year. residents would each need to go to 2.1 games a year to fill the seats. that would make seattle the nation's third-most saturated sports market behind denver (currently at 2.6 games per year) and cleveland (2.4 games), conway found.

meanwhile, the new york city area has 11 pro teams, but its huge population of 19 million gives it a sports-saturation factor of 0.7 games, ranking it just 21st in the nation. and los angeles scored 1.0 for a rank of 17th, conway said.

""based on this test, seattle does not compare favorably with new york or los angeles as a place for a new professional sports team,"" said conway, who is on the uw's geography faculty and founded dick conway & associates.

""this does not necessarily mean,"" he added, ""that seattle cannot handle two more teams. but it does suggest that the marketing of the basketball and hockey teams might be more difficult than currently presumed.""

uw geography professor emeritus bill beyers conducted a separate analysis that came to a similar conclusion. but he added that two extra teams would likely divert some attendance away from seattle's current sports teams.

asking whether seattle can support two additional teams, beyers said, is a difficult question.

""we know from the past,"" conway said, ""that we can support the sonics under pretty much the same situation."" but adding hockey and a new arena complicates the matter.

conway said further study, such as a survey of potential basketball and hockey attendees, may be warrented.

but it should be noted that, these days, attendance is no longer the largest factor in a sport's team's financial success. the majority of a team's revenue comes from broadcast contracts and sponsorship deals -- though the more attendance, of course, the better.

the arena panel's presentation to the king county council's budget and fiscal management committee on thursday also included an analysis of the proposed arena's potential effect on traffic -- both in sodo and across the metro area.

that's been a point of contention for the port of seattle and other organizations that represent the shipping industry. they have warned that increased weeknight traffic in sodo would hamper shipping operations and could be a ""job killer"" if the port lost business.

""the fact that sports traffic affects sodo is reflected in the data,"" said doug macdonald, former washington state secretary of transportation, who did his own analysis of potential arena traffic.

weeknight events at a new arena would add about 6,000 cars to the road, mostly on interstates 5 and 90, he said, which already carry 17,000 to 18,000 cars during rush hour. but because hansen expects most arena traffic to occur between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., seattle's rush hour would effectively be extended about another hour, macdonald said.

that would happen between 71 and 101 times per year -- depending on whether the nba, nhl or wnba teams made their respective playoffs. if you add that to the number of weekday mariners, sounders and seahawks games that already occur, there would be 136 to 180 weeknight events in sodo per year. other arena events, such as concerts, would push that number higher.

considering all six seattle teams, there would be six weeknights a year on which multiple sports events would occur, macdonald said. during a banner year, if all six teams made it to the playoffs, there would be 22 weeknights with multiple games.

the county councilmembers -- and the seattle city councilmembers, for that matter -- will have to ask themselves, ""is this what we want as a transportation scenario out of this opportunity?"" macdonald said.

he said the effects of extra congestion on port operations will need to be studied further. the port should clarify, he said, how shipping traffic might be affected if most cargo loading and unloading stops at 4:30 p.m. hansen has said arena traffic wouldn't be an issue for the port because most games wouldn't start until 7 p.m.

meanwhile, conway said, seattle's shipping industry is facing steeper competition from other ports and could be under threat by the widening of the panama canal. while transportation issues in sodo should not be ignored, the port of seattle has even bigger things to worry about if it really wants to nearly double its cargo traffic in the next 25 years, as is the plan.

""if i were at the port of seattle,"" conway said, ""i would think the arena would be the least of what we are worried about.""

finances and a new arena

hansen had been working behind the scenes with seattle mayor mike mcginn's office for nearly a year on a plan that could bring the nba back to town -- and potentially the nhl. once the conversation went public in february, it only took a few months for the city and county to announce a ""memorandum of understanding"" that spells out a proposed structure for the government's involvement with building a $490 million arena.

under the agreement, the city and county would contribute $200 million total, obtained via bonds, to the arena project if hansen can nail down both an nba and nhl team. the city's share is $120 million; the county's is $80 million.

of that total, $100 million is set aside to purchase the land -- which hansen already owns and has estimated is worth around $50 million -- at the land's appraised value, whatever that ends up being. the remainder of that $200 million would go to purchasing the arena building once it's built, about two years later.

that's one scenario. if only an nba team is involved, the city would contribute $115 million and the county would front just $5 million. the arena would still be built, with the extra cost being made up by hansen's investment group. and the arena would still be capable of hosting professional hockey if seattle eventually got an nhl team.

this makes for two 30-year public bonds: one for buying the land and one for buying the arena about two years later.

over those 32 years, the bonds would be paid back by taxes on arena operations -- mainly through admissions and b&o taxes -- and by $2 million in annual rent from hansen's group. if the taxes and base rent don't add up to the city and county's required annual bond payment, hansen has pledged to make up the difference by paying extra rent.

any annual surpluses would go to a public reserve fund for improvements to the arena, and eventually -- potentially -- into the general fund, where the city and county's revenue could be used for civic projects.

justin marlowe, a public fiscal management specialist at uw's evans school of public affairs, did his own analysis as part of the king county council's arena review panel and concluded that the proposed financing deal is fair for all parties and adequately protects public funds.

""as far as the risk allocation,"" marlowe said thursday, ""this is one of the best allocations we've seen. ... the risks are appropriately shared.""

""it is very unlikely,"" he added, ""that you would see, at least in my opinion, any adverse effects on king county's general budget as a result of this proposal.""

marlowe also noted that hansen's group would have a much more sustainable business plan if public financing were involved. in the wake of the recent economic downturn, it is difficult for private companies to get 30-year or even 20-year financing plans.

but beyers said it is still unknown how a new sports arena with two new teams would affect the economy of the entire region. much of the money generated would go to a handful of high-paid professional athletes, to hansen's ownership group and to the city of seattle.

the county should do a more in-depth study of the proposal's economic effects on the entire region, he said.

""clearly, this project is a winner for the city of seattle tax revenue stream, as the admission tax would be a large gain to city revenues,"" beyers wrote in his presentation to the county council. ""however, i argue that the relevant geography for evaluating the fiscal impracts of this proposal is not the city of seattle, but rather the larger regional economy.""

the city and county councils are scheduled to hold a public hearing on the arena proposal at 5:30 p.m. on july 19 at seattle city hall.

georgia davis, 22, was taken from her flat in aberdare, southwest of cardiff, yesterday in a seven-hour operation that involved firefighters, police and paramedics.

local media has reported that french doors at the front of the specially-adapted house had to be removed to allow crews to lift her from the ground-floor flat and into a waiting ambulance.

paramedics used the crane to shift ms davis, while police blocked off the entire street to allow for the operation, neighbours said.

""they had a big crane and the main road was closed for around an hour. it was a complete meltdown, everyone stopped,” one neighbour told walesonline.co.uk.

ms davis, who weighs in at 60 stone – or 381kg – suffers a variety of health issues because of her weight.

the five foot six woman has previously admitted to eating up to 20 kebabs a week, usually washed down with multiple cans of coca cola, which earned her the title of “fattest teenager in britain”.

“we can confirm that the fire service was brought in earlier today to assist us with access to a property in order to safely transport a patient into hospital - we do not comment on individual patients,” a spokeswoman for cwm taf university health board told walesonline.co.uk.

it’s not the first time authorities have been forced to resort to extreme techniques to help the welsh woman. in 2012, she was cut free from her house because she had become too large to get through any of her home’s doors.

part of a wall was removed and paramedics used a specially designed stretcher to move her out.

ms davis has battled the bulge for much of her life and was sent to fat camp in 2008 after her weight ballooned out to 63 stone – 400kg. despite losing 95kg by sticking to a specially designed diet she later put all of the weight back on.

her mother, lesley, said ms davis began over eating following the death of her father when she was just five.

mr. madison's affinity for the quirky knight-errant may not be a coincidence since he and his staff spend long workdays in the office at 425 west 144th street trying to wrest peace pacts from the hundreds of litigious quarrels that are brought to him by feuding neighbors, landlords, tenants, employers, employees, lovers, married couples and friends.

the five-year-old center operates, according to its brochure, ''as an alternative to arrest and prosecution for cases involving crimes between relatives, friends and neighbors.'' it utilizes the techniques of labor arbitration and it has the blessing of the police department, the offices of the district attorneys and the city's courts because it helps ease congested court calendars. all three refer cases to the center.

the center is now operated by the city but the idea for such a place was nurtured some years ago by the ford foundation. its hours are mondays through thursdays from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

bill madison is a spirited, witty man who thrives on the procession of raw material for soap opera, comedy and tragedy that comes before him and remains unjaded by it all. last year the center mediated 2,601 disputes, in most cases averting court battles.

the center's mediators are laymen trained to listen and to be objective and the staff of 30 usually spends a couple of hours on a case, mr. madison says.

''we don't like the word adjudicate, we like the word resolve,'' he says. ''we get them all and some are really out to lunch.'' when a case is resolved the disputers sign an agreement written by the mediator. if the pact is violated, the case can then go to court.

it is a busy morning. the seats in the corridor outside the stark mediation rooms are filling up with disputants, some of them glowering at each other, almost all of them accompanied by what mr. madison calls ''the auxiliaries'' - relatives and friends lending moral support.

mr. madison is talking about the need for the mediators to create ''a supportive climate'' when the bout of sociologese is interrupted by shouting and cursing in the corridor. he moves quickly to the door of his office and returns with three people - an angry woman named magdalena, her mother and her husband, steve.

magdalena is seething with fury, saying that the other party to her dispute, a woman named gillian, has insulted her mother in the corridor. mr. madison calms her down and sends for james warren, a mediator. the three are sent back to the waiting area after a little talk on restraint.

mr. warren says the dispute deals with a charge of ''excesive noise,'' one of the most common of the center's complaints and one mr. madison says is often fraught with racial and ethnic tensions.

the gillian woman, a waitress who must get up at 5:30 a.m., brought action against magdalena and her husband for playing their stereo late at night very loudly and murdering her sleep. the antagonism had grown until the two women ended up fighting in the elevator of their building.

the flare up in the corridor occurred after the two parties had met with mr. warren and agreed to a truce. mr. madison orders the feuding neighbors back into mr. warren's office. ''if they're fighting and fussing in the hallway we haven't done our job,'' the director says.

an hour later an agreement is signed. magdalena and steve say they'll wear headsets late at night and gillian agrees to stay clear of any contact with magdalena.

the young mediator's next case involves a charge of harassment by a tenant, mrs. chernak, against her landlord, mr. hans. a reporter is permitted at the closed session provided real names are not used.

the room is bare except for a folding table and three chairs. in a soft voice, mr. warren says, ''i'm here to assist you in making an agreement to resolve your differences.''

mrs. chernak says that mr. hans badgered her to vacate her rent controlled apartment in his queens building so he could install his mother-in-law in it. she says the landlord at one point injured her arm in a hallway bout that involved name-calling.

mr. hans says she was rude, calling him a ''rent gouger.'' he denies assaulting her. ''you think you're under rent control you can do anything,'' he blurts.

mr. warren skillfully lets them complain - up to a point. when the recriminations get to blown fuses and a complicated back and forth about amperage, the mediator decides enough fuses have been blown and moves in.

''what would you like to see resolved?'' he asks. ''that he stop harassing me,'' says mrs. chernak. ''o.k.,'' says mr. hans. mr. warren draws up an agreement. they both sign, pocket their copies of the pact and , without a glance at each other, leave looking relieved.

mr. madison smiles as they leave, and returns to his task of tilting at windmills of human frailty."

it may be the saddest commentary of all on large corporations doing business for shareholders but seemingly unconcerned about their assets. when unions need to fund an energy study to find out how the plant can run more efficiently and obtain the energy it needs, it is time to wonder whether or not management is in any way competent. the cogeneration option is around in many industries as it is in many localities in the form of district heating and energy.

this, by the way, could be an option for areas in westchester county, which has among the highest utility r ates in the nation. cogeneration and district heating is working many areas of new york city boroughs, but consolidated edison has op posed it for very real economic reasons - that it cuts into its cust omer base and, the argument goes, contributes to pollution. the very fact that our utility supplier has not encouraged any more economic forms of energysupply to its customers - in view of its shar eholders' sinking values- would seem to argue that it is time energy users demanded more innovation with the enormous capital resource s our utility supplier has at hand.

public relations experts have generally given mobil high marks for its techniques. but yesterday, many said mobil might have overplayed its aggressiveness and embarrassed itself with a series of price reversals this week in response to new state taxes on oil companies.

''it looked like they were out to gouge the public,'' said an executive vice president at one of the largest public relations firms in new york. ''it was a serious public relations mistake. they ended up going through a lot of grief they didn't have to.''

herbert schmertz, a mobil vice president and director of its public relations, declined to answer questions yesterday about mobil's response to the tax legislation.

from the moment the new york state assembly began to consider a package of five taxes designed to aid mass transit, mobil was in the forefront of opposition, buttonholing legislators and taking out $80,000 worth of ads in 14 state newspapers. tax bill signed sunday

this effort, however, failed last sunday when the package, which included a three-quarters of 1 percent tax on oil company gross receipts and a new formula to calculate oil company franchise taxes, was signed into law.

but the biggest setback came this week, when mobil announced a 3-cent-a-gallon rise in the price of its gasoline. while other companies hung back, saying they were studying the situation, mobil defended the increase, drawing denunciations from mayor koch and pickets at mobil stations.

in response, mobil replied that it had considered raising prices even more, but that market conditions would not permit it. this tough talk was followed by more conciliatory words by the end of the week. on closer scrunity, mobil said, it now agreed with state officials who had contended that mobil had misunderstood such key provisions of the legislation as its starting date and the fact that much of the tax fell on retail dealers, not on mobil. now, mobil said, the price increase would only be 1.3 cents a gallon. company spokesmen, however, told reporters that mobil was still unable to explain the arithmetic used to reach this conclusion.

''you don't test the waters with trial balloons and then reverse your position,'' said howard j. rubenstein, president of howard j. rubenstein associates.

despite this, some public relations experts said yesterday that mobil's stance had been effective in shaping public opinion more favorably toward the oil companies and had encouraged other oil companies to adopt more forceful advertising campaigns.

mobil maintains a $21 million budget for all advertising, from sponsorship of public television programs to lobbying legislators. ''i'm an admirer of mobil as a whole,'' said graham h. phillips, managing director of olgilvy & mather. ''they've taken a courageous stance on key issues facing us, and as far as i know they've been effective. before mobil's public issue campaign, oil companies took a lot of grief from the press. our research into the attitudes towards the company shows they've had some success with the managerial segment that reads their ads.''

but, mr. phillips said, mobil's high visiblity brings high risk. ''there is danger with an advocacy campaign that you would create more negatives with positives.''

indeed, at least once during mobil's antitax campaign, the company's visibility drew attention to its opposition and gave it a large public forum. a shouting match

the incident occurred last tuesday, when the new york public interest research group, a nonprofit organization, gave a news conference near mobil headquarters in new york to criticize the increase. when the speaker called for questions from the audience, one voice raised was that of mr. schmertz. soon, a shouting match ensued between the speakers and the mobil vice president.

the result was that the confrontation received wide news coverage, and the research group, according to gene m. russianoff, a staff attorney who was the speaker at the session, got more publicity than if the company had remained silent.

''you had a colorful case of a mobil corporation vice president coming down to scream at demonstrators,'' mr. russianoff said. ''we got two-minute spots on cbs radio, and i don't think we would have gotten that much coverage alone.''

impatiently, my mother used to say to me when i was young, why is all the poetry you like about sex and death? maybe she said love and death, but i don't think so. had she added nature she would have defined for me the major themes of lyric poetry. she wrote occasional poems, observing the beginning of a season, honoring a marriage or a child's birth. sometimes they were little life histories with a moral point: this was the way life was to be lived, against these odds, at this cost. but whatever the poems were about, they were grounded in female experience, they were personal and they were deeply felt. ordinary life, she insisted, was to be celebrated, the past was to be used and remembered, and conduct was judged.

adrienne rich's poetry is not occasional, but its intent is precisely to celebrate, to bear witness and to forge connections between women's lives and their histories. and it is surely about sex: ''two women sleeping/ together have more than their sleep to defend.'' we are trying to live in a clearheaded tenderness- i speak not merely of us, our lives are 'moral and ordinary' as the lives of numberless women- it is also fiercely judgmental. ...when did we ever choose to see our bodies strung in bondage and crucifixion across the exhausted air when did we choose to be lynched on the queasy electric signs of midtown when did we choose to become the masturbator's fix

we did not choose to, it was chosen for us, and insofar as we have been powerless before that choice and have not fought against it, we are complicitous in it. in this poem, we is an exclusively female pronoun. but we are men and women both, are we not? and granting, even, that it is women who are most often ''strung in bondage,'' does that truly mean the following: ...i know my imagination lies: in the name of freedom of speech they are lynching us no law is on our side there are no boundaries no-man's-land does not exist. i can never romanticize language again never deny its power for disguise for mystification but the same could be said for music or any form created painted ceilings beaten gold worm-worn pietas reorganizing victimization frescoes translating violence into patterns so powerful and pure we continually fail to ask are they true for us. from ''the images''

adrienne rich is not asking, she is telling us that these patterns are exclusively of disguise and of violence against women and untrue. but surely there is something else going on in music and art besides the making of female victims. and while i do not underestimate male power, i find suspect her belief in lesbian purity. it is only fair to add that i find questionable the belief in anybody's purity. her imagination does not lie, and about language she has always been chaste, even severe. what she romanticizes is the self.

in ''the dream of a common language,'' the volume she published in 1978, rich made this pledge:

...two women, eye to eye measuring each other's spirit, each other's limitless desire, a whole new poetry beginning here.

the poems of ''a wild patience'' are not, i think, a whole new poetry, for the uses she makes of language as naming and knowing, of the self in a given and specific place, and of history as an act of the learned and remembering mind have been in her work from the beginning of her career thirty-odd years ago. she is, however, no longer the modest girl auden introduced in 1951. we are in the presence here of a major american poet whose voice at midcentury in her own life is increasingly marked by moral passion. she is as political, noble and righteous as shelley was: i want our own earth not the satellites, our world as it is if not as it might be then as it is: male dominion, gangrape, lynching, pogrom the mohican wraiths in their tracts of leafless birch watching: will we do better? ourselves as we are in these painful motions of staying cognizant: some part of us always out beyond ourselves knowing knowing knowing from ''the spirit of place''

in her best work adrienne rich transforms those powerful twin engines of the 19th century which were her legacy, intellect and feeling pitted against each other, into the seriousness of the mind and the delight of the body. it is entirely like her in the long poem ''culture and anarchy'' not only to take the title from matthew arnold (and to provide a footnote to the source) but to ground the poem in a sort of lyric monologue which she conducts with herself as she considers the 19th-century women's voices that she quotes. there is a politics at work here which is romantic and personal, for she speaks again and again as part of a couple, praising this relationship not only for what it is they share, but also for its charge to her imagination: upstairs, long silence, then again, the sudden torrent of your typing rough drafts we share, each reading her own page over the other's shoulder trying to see afresh an energy i cannot even yet take for granted: picking up a book of the nineteenth century, reading there the name of the woman whose book you found in the old town athenaeum beginning to stitch together"

another view of his work emerges in a biography that emphasizes a less well-known aspect of his creative life -painting the islanders and coastal scenes of martha's vineyard, where he spent his summers from 1920 until his death in 1975 at the age of 86. ''thomas hart benton: a portrait'' by polly burroughs is published by doubleday.

the author, a vineyard neighbor in the last three years of benton's life, offers a number of observations based on taped interviews with the artist. benton, who spent long periods in europe assimilating its splendors and styles, says that before discovering the vineyard, he lived ''15 years on my beam-end, rocked by every wave that came along.'' more repertorial than analytical

the biography, more reportorial than analytical, supplements a more comprehensive study of the artist's life and work, matthew baigell's ''thomas hart benton,'' published by abrams. what special vision is there of benton in the new work?

miss burroughs, from her home in the vineyard, said: ''to me, the most important element is that he quite dramatically turned his back on abstract modern art. nature got to him on the secluded massachusetts island. he told me, 'it was in martha's vineyard that i first really began an intimate study of the american environment and its people.' most people thought he was strictly from missouri in his outlook.

''he was a deeply divided man politically, too. originally, he had equated american democratic ideals with those proclaimed by soviet russia, and he saw communism as an extension of democracy. but in my taped interviews with him in the last summer of his life, he told me that the stalinist period later proved him right when he turned his back in 1928 on the use of art as social propaganda.'' lobsterman's shack in chilmark

the author recounts the artist's love affair with the vineyard. it began in 1920, when several fellow-artists and critics in new york, including william scott and thomas craven, informed benton and his future wife, rita piacenza, that a lobsterman's shack could be rented there for as little as $10 a month. the isolated fishing and farming area they settled in was chilmark, on the western end of the island.

there he painted such subjects as ''waves,'' ''man with boat'' and ''launching the boat,'' fusing foaming waves and swirling sky, which whitney darrow called ''benton's hollow and bump'' period.

the western tip of the vineyard comes to a dramatic climax at gay head cliffs, and benton executed several versions of the cliffs against the sea. ''the first thing i ever did on the island was a sketch of the wesquobsque cliffs,'' on south beach, the artist told the author.

benton also portrayed his neighbors. in ''the people of chilmark,'' he posed his wife, her brother and friends like mr. craven engaged in activities from boating to basketball. he explained that the swirling assemblage of figures was a continuation of his renaissance studies. and he did a self-portrait of himself on south beach. it included his nephew and wife who, in the eyes of one observer, looked ''less a bathing beauty than a madonna.'' flourished during depression

there are a number of paintings of menemsha fishermen along the wharves. during prohibition, benton painted the local fishermen unloading bootleg liquor. walking along south beach, benton recalled, ''we used to pick up scotch and rye, good golden wedding canadian whisky.''

miss burroughs says that while most artists barely eked out a living during the depression, benton received major commissions; his easel pictures brought up to $5,000. he basked in the spotlight and blasted his artistic adversaries.

''the only place he seemed to let down his guard was on the island,'' the author writes. ''for those closest to him, unless he was drinking, tom was quiet, reflective, philosophical, embarrassingly frank about himself with an infectious wit, and genuinely sensitive to the poetry of the island.''

of his role as an american painter, miss burroughs quotes benton: ''regionalism has become a fashionable term now. it's getting more respectable than when curry, grant and i'' - referring to his fellow artists john steuart curry and grant wood -''were trying to attain the american expression, each in our own way. although i've never met him, i have great respect for andy wyeth. he's a great artist - more more regionalist than i am, although i was the first, along with curry and grant. you see i've covered the country - walking the length and breadth of it for months on end trying to understand it before expressing it. i sketched the whole damn country from new york to hollywood.''"
"the last major scheduled test of the space shuttle columbia was completed yesterday, but space agency officials said that they would not know until late tomorrow if the refurbished insulation on the huge shuttle tank withstood the fueling exercise. they spent much of the week practicing landings in aircraft at edwards and training in shuttle simulators at the johnson space center at houston.","the last major scheduled test of the space shuttle columbia was completed yesterday, but space agency officials said that they would not know until late tomorrow if the refurbished insulation on the huge shuttle tank withstood the fueling exercise.

preliminary inspections, conducted while the 15-story-high external tank was being filled with supercold propellants, disclosed no evidence that any of the cork-epoxy insulation had come unglued, george f. page, the launching director at the kennedy space center in florida, reported. in a similar fueling operation last january, several large patches of insulation came loose, setting back launching plans and requiring $2.5 million worth of repairs.

a more detailed investigation is to be conducted today and tomorrow after the cylindrical tank's two chambers are purged of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. these are the propellants for the three main rocket engines that are designed to drive the re-usable winged spacecraft most of its way into orbit.

officials of the national aeronautics and space administration plan an all-day flight-readiness review meeting tuesday at the kennedy center. at that time, depending on the results of the fueling test, they are expected to announce a firm launching date, probably no earlier than april 9 or 10. if the inspections reveal any substantial damage to the tanks, however, the columbia's first orbital flight could be postponed for several weeks.

john w. young and capt. robert l. crippen of the navy are set to fly the columbia around the earth 36 times in 54 1/2 hours, taking off from launching pad 39-a at cape canaveral and gliding to a airplanelike landing at edwards air force base in california. they spent much of the week practicing landings in aircraft at edwards and training in shuttle simulators at the johnson space center at houston.

completion of yesterday's fueling test was delayed three hours because of a minor hydrogen leak at the point where fuel hoses attach to the shuttle. engineers said that the leak had been sealed and was not considered a serious problem.

another fueling test, in which even greater stresses were applied to the insulation, was conducted wednesday and was an apparent success."
"21— this old german seafaring city has been watching the political winds since the 13th century and observes the present east-west storm with a very canny eye. but even here there is relief that washington has finally offered a plan for negotiating a pause in the arms race. reagan's speech did not quell the anxiety but it certainly helped. we have been listening to radio moscow here in hamburg these last few days. reagan's proposals worth considering -all this directed from moscow at the leaders of the anti-nuclear demonstrators in west germany. just as it rejected the marshall plan as a trap, and the baruch, acheson, lillienthal and eisenhower plans for the control of nuclear weapons as american tricks to dominate europe and therefore threaten the soviet union, so it is now condemning the reagan proposals as another u.s. reagan is trying to create with his negotiating proposals.","hamburg, west germany, nov. 21— this old german seafaring city has been watching the political winds since the 13th century and observes the present east-west storm with a very canny eye.

over half of it was totally destroyed in the last world war and has now been restored and modernized with exquisite taste. it is only 20 miles from the soviet tanks in communist east germany. it is also a center of the popular west german publishing houses that have dramatized the european anti-nuclear peace demonstrations.

accordingly, it is perhaps less impressed by president reagan's nuclear arms proposals than the present west german government in bonn. but even here there is relief that washington has finally offered a plan for negotiating a pause in the arms race.

this is not much, but at least it is agreed here that there is now hope for a new beginning. before the president's speech - with mr. reagan showing little enthusiasm for arms control talks, with his lieutenants talking casually about limited nuclear war, and the nato alliance in doubt about the future - this country, already studded with 6,000 nuclear weapons, faced a public revolt against adding new cruise and pershing 2 nuclear weapons. mr. reagan's speech did not quell the anxiety but it certainly helped.

its effectiveness may be measured first by chancellor helmut schmidt's enthusiastic response, but also by moscow's savage condemnation of it as a fraud and a deception. we have been listening to radio moscow here in hamburg these last few days. before president brezhnev arrived in west germany, it bombarded this country with an artillery barrage of propaganda, without the slightest suggestion that there was anything in mr. reagan's proposals worth considering -all this directed from moscow at the leaders of the anti-nuclear demonstrators in west germany.

moscow's strategy is quite clear. just as it rejected the marshall plan as a trap, and the baruch, acheson, lillienthal and eisenhower plans for the control of nuclear weapons as american tricks to dominate europe and therefore threaten the soviet union, so it is now condemning the reagan proposals as another u.s. plot.

by so doing, the russians apparently hope to encourage the leaders of the anti-nuclear demonstrations in europe to raise such a public howl in the streets that mr. schmidt and the other west european leaders will not be able to agree to the emplacement of any new u.s. cruise or pershing 2 missiles in europe and thus leave the soviet union's

ss-20 and ss-4 and ss-5 missiles dominating the european balance of power. yet, it would probably be a mistake to take all these pronouncements out of moscow and even out of washington too seriously for the moment. this is not the end, but only the propaganda beginning of a long negotiating process that will start in geneva at the end of this month.

between now and then, it might be helpful to avoid, or at least minimize, charges of bad faith, if both sides would try to clarify an important preliminary question.

there is a fundamental conflict in the public statements out of the u.s. and soviet governments about the facts of (1) what the present balance of missile power is in europe and (2) about what that balance or imbalance would be if the u.s. or soviet proposals were accepted.

so far, the propaganda on both sides has concentrated on the intentions or motives of each other, which is a dangerous guessing game. but the facts can be measured or at least clarified.

president reagan has defined the facts of the miltiary imbalance, as he sees them. moscow has rejected washington's analysis as nonsense and insisted there is no imbalance except the one mr. reagan is trying to create with his negotiating proposals.

at best this is a tangle of complicated military and scientific problems, beyond the understanding of most mortals. but it has been thrown into the arena of public opinion, and at least moscow can take mr. reagan's ''facts,'' one by one, and instead of dismissing them as misleading rubbish, publish their answering ''facts'' so that there can be a more rational basis for comparison.

some progress obviously has been made. the president has finally made an excellent speech, which six months ago might have avoided much trouble with both the allies and the russians. he has been responsive to the objections of the soviet union, the nato governments and the leaders of the anti-nuclear movement that he was avoiding negotiations and had no clear proposals for negotiation.

now, however, he is entitled to a fair hearing from them all. he is getting it from chancellor schmidt and the other nato leaders, and also from some anti-nuclear organizations here.

yet it is not clear in hamburg that they will give his concerns as much consideration as he has tardily and reluctantly given theirs. they are not anti-american, they insist, but they are mockingly anti-reagan, and will not be convinced by his speech until it is followed by serious negotiations on both sides at geneva."

the paper, the voice of szczecin, was published under strict censorship so presumably it has police as well as official party endorsement. it said jews had been causing trouble for poland since 1947, and recently tried to take power through dissidents.

this kind of smear is not new. anti-semitic graffiti have appeared in warsaw. leading solidarity advisers have been accused of links with ''zionist centers.'' a shadowy organization called grunwald emerged a year ago distributing nationalist and anti-semitic propaganda in a way that to many poles smacked of police provocation. grunwald was the site of a battle in 1410 when the poles beat the teutonic knights, a medieval symbol.

but the szczecin paper was far more overt than anything before in giving formal communist sanction to anti-semitic demagogy in an effort to divert hostility to the regime.

similar attempts have been made at almost every time of ferment in poland since world war ii. in 1956, the soviet ambassador was caught red-handed (for once the cliche is apposite) distributing unsigned anti-jewish tracts from his limousine in the countryside. he was replaced afterward, but the campaign was maintained by hard-line polish communists.

in the 1967-68 purge of intellectuals and students, the hard-liners made widespread attacks against jews in their struggle for dominance in the party. the leader of the purge was mieczyslaw moczar, a high party official, and a close associate was stefan olszowski, now a politburo member in charge of polish media.

mr. olszowski has played a wavering role in the polish upheaval, sometimes appearing as a moscow favorite and sometimes claiming moderate views, but always managing to scramble to the winning side.

the local party committee in szczecin, a major baltic port and industrial city, is known as particularly hard-line. recently exiled poles interpret the christmas tirade as a veiled attack on deputy prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski, long a moderate and openly opposed to the use of anti-semitism, and perhaps also on gen. wojciech jaruzelski, who always refrained from joining the campaign. mr. rakowski and mr. olszowski have been open ri vals in the past.

it feels demeaning to have to read the entrails of such dirty tactics to discern the political battles going on be-neath the taut surface of the military regime. but it is important because it is a sign that whatever general jaruzelski's intentions, he and his generals are managing no better now to overcome the orthodox factions in the party who blocked efforts at effective reform and the ''renewal'' that he promised to restore.

there are hardly any jews left in poland. some 30,000, the bulk of the tiny community that survived the war, emigrated more or less voluntarily during the 1968 purges. many of them were communists, and it is true that jews played an important role in the security police that imposed the regime under stalin. memories of polish anti-semitism and the idealistic dogma of communism in opposition to the nazis had drawn them in.

clearly, the szczecin paper and the campaign in general were seeking to stir resentments provoked as a result, an attempt to identify jews with stalinism - as though the present hard-liners had been honest patriots.

it is a mindless and desperate attempt to find scapegoats. but it is also a general reminder that historic injustice evoked as a pretext to perpetuate hatred serves only the cause of injustice. no nation is pure. each has suffered and inflicted suffering.

ugly as the use of anti-semitism is - in poland of all places, where millions of jews were murdered by the nazis - there are ironies that illuminate the present situation.

even with resort to outright lies, it isn't easy to concoct propaganda to support the return to terror as the basis of government. calling for ''national reconciliation'' makes it hard to blame poles for the debacle, except for a few so-called extremists and discredited communist leaders.

so an outside demon is needed. the longstanding target, west germany, is excluded now. west germany is poland's biggest creditor, and german-soviet rapprochement has spoiled the argument that poland must look to moscow for defense against german revenge. moscow may denounce the u.s., but that works poorly in poland, which still hopes for american aid and where one-fourth of the people have relatives in the united states. america is popular.

that leaves the old cry against jews. with biting polish wit, a solidarity adviser now abroad said: ''these people are going to compromise anti-semitism in poland. if they go on, they'll make 'international zionism' popular.''

if a final proof of the bankruptcy of the polish communists were needed, the voice of szczecin has given it."

grouper has three fairly strong offerings in the video space - a p2p network, a video editor and, more recently, a web-based video-sharing service at grouper.com. the site provides instant posting of videos to myspace, friendster, blogger and wordpress, as well as downloads for your desktop, ipod and sony psp. the company is the second largest independent video sharing community, behind youtube by a long way. it's also worth noting that grouper's content is fairly edgy, and it lists even more copyrighted content than its rival - the top rated videos are currently full episodes of south park, the simpsons and family guy. they've taken around $5.25 million in funding from t-ventures (t-online’s investment arm) and duff, ackerman, goodrich.

where are the synergies? grouper and sony claim that the pairing of connected devices with grouper's web and desktop sharing will be a big win, and grouper's p2p platform could also be used for movie distribution. what's pretty clear is that this is a technology buy, since grouper hadn't even made a dent in web-based services like myspace video, youtube and yahoo video."

pfizer recently approached allergan and the process is at an early stage, the journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.

though details of the talks were unclear, the companies could face obstacles such as agreeing on a price, layoffs, and the closing of facilities, the journal said.

late wednesday, joan campion, a spokeswoman for pfizer, said the company does not comment on speculation, while mark marmur at allergan declined to comment.

a transaction between the two drug makers, which have a combined market value exceeding $330 billion, could cap a busy year for deals in the pharmaceutical industry, with more than $200 billion in transactions announced.

that includes pfizer’s $17 billion deal for hospira inc., a maker of injectable drugs.

an acquisition of allergan, which has its legal domicile in dublin, may also let pfizer relocate outside of the united states for tax purposes. that was one of the reasons pfizer sought to acquire astrazeneca last year before eventually withdrawing its proposal. pfizer also looked at actavis as a potential acquisition, people familiar with the matter said last year.

the largest deal ever in the drug industry was pfizer’s $116 billion acquisition of warner-lambert co. in 2000, data compiled by bloomberg show.

pfizer has sought deals in recent years as patents have expired for key drugs, including the cholesterol-lowering medicine lipitor.

allergan has been active on both sides of the deal table and has accounted for about $131 billion in deals over the past two years.

allergan, itself the result of an acquisition earlier this year, is also slimming down, selling its generic-drug unit to teva pharmaceutical industries ltd. for $40.5 billion. sales at allergan, which has a market capitalization of about $113 billion, have benefited from sales of specialty drugs including the cosmetic drug botox and namenda for alzheimer’s disease.

pfizer’s shares have risen 14 percent this year, and allergan’s have gained 12 percent, both outperforming the standard & poor’s 1.5 percent advance."
"frankfurt, aug 11 (reuters) - european exporters glimpsed the possible progressive erosion of lucrative benefits from the weak euro on tuesday, as china's surprise devaluation made foreign goods more expensive for its consumers and corporate customers. sectors with the highest exposure are basic resources, personal and household goods, technology, chemicals and autos. the exporter-heavy german blue-chip dax fell 2.7 percent, with automakers daimler, bmw and volkswagen leading the way as china's car industry association reported the biggest monthly drop in vehicle sales in 2-1/2 years, even before any devaluation impact. evercore autos analyst arndt ellinghorst said the 2 percent devaluation would not be material for german carmakers, with zero impact this year thanks to hedging and an operating profit impact of around 1 percent next year. ""the timing certainly aligns with current efforts to further prop up growth in non-financial sectors,"" wrote ihs global insight china economist brian jackson. ""move up a little bit further and you can start thinking about medical equipment, where we have been very cautious about the chinese domestic landscape for philips and siemens, but this increases the attractiveness for domestic players to start to export,"" he said.","frankfurt, aug 11 (reuters) - european exporters glimpsed the possible progressive erosion of lucrative benefits from the weak euro on tuesday, as china's surprise devaluation made foreign goods more expensive for its consumers and corporate customers.

shares fell in makers of cars, luxury goods and consumer products, wiping 140 billion euros ($155 billion) off the value of the ftseurofirst 300 index, as the spectre loomed of a new round of currency wars.

european companies from l'oreal to siemens have benefited from the euro's weakness making their products cheaper abroad and lifting the value of sales in other currencies, while chinese growth has masked weakness elsewhere.

china is the second-biggest buyer of eu goods after the united states, accounting for 14 percent of exports from the trade bloc last year, according to eurostat.

the chinese central bank's 2 percent cut in its official dollar-to-yuan guidance rate sparked fears of more such moves to come and gave support to concerns the world's second-biggest economy would miss its 7 percent growth target for this year.

""the biggest impact is what this says about chinese growth,"" said liberum consumer goods analyst robert waldschmidt. ""when you look at the actual companies, clearly anyone that's exporting to china is going to have a harder time.""

sectors with the highest exposure are basic resources, personal and household goods, technology, chemicals and autos.

the european basic resources index, already down 16 percent in the past three months, fell a further 4.1 percent; the autos index fell 4.1 percent and the personal and household goods index slid 2.4 percent.

the exporter-heavy german blue-chip dax fell 2.7 percent, with automakers daimler, bmw and volkswagen leading the way as china's car industry association reported the biggest monthly drop in vehicle sales in 2-1/2 years, even before any devaluation impact.

""the rotation out of exporters to more domestically focused stocks and sectors, in italy or spain for example, has more to go,"" said dennis rose, a strategist at barclays in london.

evercore autos analyst arndt ellinghorst said the 2 percent devaluation would not be material for german carmakers, with zero impact this year thanks to hedging and an operating profit impact of around 1 percent next year.

but juergen hackenberg, head of european equities at german asset manager union investment, said: ""a continual weakening would have clear effects on companies strong in exports.""

perhaps more significant than currency translation effects is the signal sent by china of its determination to support its export-dependent industrial sector, where it is building national champions to challenge western rivals, analysts say.

""the timing certainly aligns with current efforts to further prop up growth in non-financial sectors,"" wrote ihs global insight china economist brian jackson.

china has already produced global telecoms equipment maker huawei and has created the world's biggest rail conglomerate, crrc, by merging two trainmakers.

analyst david vos of barclays said cheaper export prices would not always benefit chinese companies as often they did not yet have comparable technology to that of western rivals.

but he saw large infrastructure, power transmission and coal power generation and makers of low-end mining equipment, such as crushers and grinders, as sectors where china was competitive.

""move up a little bit further and you can start thinking about medical equipment, where we have been very cautious about the chinese domestic landscape for philips and siemens, but this increases the attractiveness for domestic players to start to export,"" he said.

state-sponsored huawei is already neck and neck with sweden's ericsson in telecoms equipment and analyst sylvain fabre at gartner said the devaluation could further strengthen its hand and that of peer zte.

but he noted huawei had long ago abandoned the cut-throat pricing strategy it used to conquer world markets and that in any case international tenders were made in dollars.

""huawei has been disciplined on price in recent years, and even zte is not in total price-war mode. there are lots of things that come into play, not just currency,"" he said.

""what is true is that the chinese vendors will have the ability to cut price a bit more if they so choose."" ($1 = 0.9056 euros)

chariot for women, the brainchild of a former uber driver in the boston area, aims to launch its women-based driving service nationwide on april 19.

“chariot was born to ensure safety, comfort and pleasure as well as giving back to female-focused charities and foundations through our transportation services,” the company’s website states, adding that a percentage of profits will be given back to women’s foundations.

founder michael pelletz came up with the idea after picking up a passenger who made him feel unsafe.

“one thought kept coming up in his head: ‘what if i was a woman?’” the company’s website states. “just one bad apple behind the wheel, and those women would not be safe at all. 3 a.m. in boston is a candy store for predators.”

in an e-mail to the globe, pelletz said chariot for women fares would be comparable to competitors like uber and lyft, but without the surge pricing.

he said he was hoping to employ 1,000 drivers by launch, but after an “overwhelming response,” that number has climbed to 4,000.

based in charlton, mass., pelletz said he plans for chariot for women to “have offices very soon in every major city across the country.”

the service’s launch comes as services like uber and lyft are under scrutiny for a myriad of reasons, including safety.

boston police were investigating two separate assaults this past weekend that they say involved assailants masquerading as ride-sharing drivers.

tim russo had never really known anyone with autism before. but in september 2013, when he was volunteering at jetblue’s blue horizon for autism event, which lets families with autistic kids experience the airport in a controlled setting, he found himself getting along effortlessly with his fellow volunteer, an autistic teenager named jason harris. “we started talking about aircraft routing and pairing,” tim says. “just by looking at the tail number of a plane, he knew the name of the plane. that’s what i do for a living—i remember thinking, this is fun!” russo, who manages strategic initiatives within technical operations for jetblue (no. 454), gave harris his contact information.

“i know that the clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over. they’re wrong,” sanders said in a telephone interview with the associated press from new albany, indiana. “maybe it’s over for the insiders and the party establishment but the voters today in indiana had a different idea.”

sanders spoke to the ap after he defeated clinton in indiana’s primary, predicting that he would achieve “more victories in the weeks to come” in west virginia, kentucky, oregon and california. the vermont senator acknowledged that he faced an “uphill climb” to the democratic nomination but said he was “in this campaign to win and we are going to fight until the last vote is cast.”

sanders’ win in indiana likely won’t make much of a dent in clinton’s lead of more than 300 pledged delegates. clinton is still more than 90% of the way to clinching the democratic nomination when the count includes superdelegates, the elected officials and party leaders who are free to support the candidate of their choice.

sanders said in the interview that he would be the best-positioned democrat to take on republican donald trump, who is now the likely republican nominee after texas sen. ted cruz dropped out of the race. “there is nothing more i would like than to take on and defeat donald trump, someone who must never become president of this country.”

sanders said he had no intention to drop out of the race and rejected the notion that his criticism of clinton’s record on issues like trade, campaign finance and the iraq war would help trump.

“there is nothing that i have said about secretary clinton that the republicans are not more than aware of. they must have dozens and dozens of opposition researchers,” sanders said. “they will go into areas that i have chosen not to go into. they will be talking about emails. they will be talking about the clinton foundation.”

sanders said he wants to debate clinton in california later this month, noting that both campaigns had reached an agreement in principle to hold the forum in the nation’s largest state."

also, judge lance a. ito delayed a decision on whether to exclude from the trial crucial blood samples -- including blood found on mr. simpson's ford bronco and a glove retrieved outside mr. simpson's home -- because prosecutors waited too long to begin dna testing. that decision will not come until at least tuesday.

defense lawyers have argued that prosecutors were trying to buy time to build a case against mr. simpson. on friday, judge ito hinted that he was sympathetic to the defense argument and might bar any test results produced after a certain date from the trial.

mr. simpson, a former football star, is accused of murder in the stabbing deaths of nicole simpson, his former wife, and her friend ronald l. goldman on june 12. ms. brown said in her statement that the halloween costumes portraying mr. simpson and his former wife were in ""extremely bad taste."" she urged consumers and merchants to boycott them and related halloween paraphernalia, like knives, bloodied skirts and afro and blond wigs.

""it is a holiday where children dress up and have a good time pretending to be someone else,"" she said. ""this type of costume is in extremely bad taste and has no redeeming value for our society. murder and domestic violence is no laughing matter, and the total disrespect for grieving families in general is appalling.""

after long keeping silent, members of the brown family have recently begun to speak about their feelings that they have been exploited by people trying to sensationalize and profit from their loss. the statement today was distributed by human options capital campaign cabinet, an organization that helps victims of domestic violence.

many shops reported that there had been little interest in the simpson items. phillip reynoso, an employee at halloween castle in los angeles, said: ""we did have a guy come here and offer some masks, and some people have been asking for them, but i didn't want to take them. i just wanted to give o. j. simpson a break.""

in court earlier in the day, two prospective jurors were excused from the trial after voicing apprehension about the amount of attention the trial is receiving and the potential loss of their privacy.

one was the woman identified as juror no. 32, who became well known because she was the first juror questioned during the preliminary phase of voir dire, the juror screening process, and because her court number is the same as the number mr. simpson wore on both his college and professional football jerseys.

she said her privacy had already been compromised by the simpson case, citing a recent skit on the television program ""saturday night live"" in which, she said, an actor playing juror 32 winked at judge ito.

""the media ruined it,"" the woman said. ""a lot of people feel the way i feel.""

asked how other people knew that she was a potential juror in the simpson case, she said, ""if people asked me directly, i'm not going to lie.""

also dismissed was a potential juror who said she had suffered domestic violence for many years. she said she could not bear to be questioned on the subject.

""i don't care to relive those memories,"" she said, her voice quaking. ""i just become emotional about it."""
"a german nurse jailed for life last year for murdering two patients is now a suspect in at least 33 more deaths, investigators said wednesday, adding that he has admitted to have killed even more. nils h. eventually admitted to injecting some 90 patients with the drug so he could then try to revive them and, when successful, shine as a saviour before his medical peers. the sweeping investigation is expected to take many more months.","a german nurse jailed for life last year for murdering two patients is now a suspect in at least 33 more deaths, investigators said wednesday, adding that he has admitted to have killed even more.

the man, identified only as niels h., 39 who was jailed for life in february 2015, has been found guilty of two murders and three attempted murders of intensive-care patients.

he had previously claimed to have killed more than 30 patients with lethal overdoses at the delmenhorst hospital near the northern city of bremen, which would make him one of germany's worst post-war serial killers.

analyses carried out on 99 exhumed patients at delmenhorst suggest that at least 33 were killed by the nurse through lethal injections, investigators said wednesday.

but they added that the tall and heavyset man had also admitted to killing other patients at another hospital nearby -- the oldenburg clinic, without giving a figure.

""we can say that the horror hasn't ended,"" said johann kuehme, police chief of the city of oldenburg.

oldenburg prosecutor thomas sander added that in addition to the 33 likely cases, ""we assume that the real number of victims is higher than that.""

hundreds of patient records will be examined at the oldenburg clinic before deciding if mass exhumations of patient corpses would need to be carried out there as well.

the grisly case dates back to 2005, when a colleague witnessed niels h. injecting a patient at the delmenhorst hospital.

the patient survived and niels h. was arrested and, in 2008, sentenced to seven and a half years in jail for attempted murder.

amid the media publicity, a woman then contacted police, voicing suspicion that her deceased mother had also fallen victim to the killer-nurse.

the authorities exhumed several patients' bodies and detected traces of the drug in five of them, declaring it either the definitive or possible contributing cause.

nils h. eventually admitted to injecting some 90 patients with the drug so he could then try to revive them and, when successful, shine as a saviour before his medical peers.

he said he felt euphoric when he managed to bring a patient back to life, and devastated when he failed.

after the shocking revelations of the nurse's murderous obsession, police and prosecutors launched a special forensic commission dubbed ""kardio"" (cardio) to look into other patient deaths.

the sweeping investigation is expected to take many more months.

the nurse had previously also worked at an elderly home and an emergency medical service."

fortune — we continue to populate our planet with systems that have catastrophic potential despite the known risks. case in point: nuclear power plants, which house fearful concentrations of hazardous materials, are often located in densely populated areas, and whose owners wield great political clout thanks to consolidation in the nuclear power industry. unfortunately we are now seeing the consequences of this centralization.

japan, an island without other energy sources, has sprinkled its coastline with nuclear power plants; two, the fukushima and the onagawa facilities, were built in an area known for its seismic activity. documents show regulators and managers in japan treated “worst case” events as outliers—not real risks. in 2006 a group called the nuclear safety commission recognized the danger of tsunamis hitting japan’s coastal plants but reassuringly concluded: “even for a nuclear plant situated very close to sea level, the robust sealed containment structure around the reactor itself would prevent any damage to the nuclear part from a tsunami, though other parts of the plant might be damaged. no radiological hazard would be likely.” we now know how inadequate those containment structures proved to be.

the nuclear industry is dominated by a handful of companies. westinghouse was bought by toshiba; the french company areva dominates in europe and is now in joint projects in the u.s., one company supplies it with a third of its electric power. exelon exc and entergy etr run most of them in the u.s. consolidation has given companies size and influence to lobby governments for less oversight, which helps them operate more efficiently–and maximize profits quarter after quarter. (though the industry by necessity has to think long term—due to permissions and planning it may take 10 years to build a facility that will have a 40- to 60-year life span—nuclear power companies are as beholden to wall street’s short-term mentality as any corporation.)

but perhaps a more threatening form of concentration in this dangerous industry is at the facility level. one of tokyo electric’s facilities has 7 plants on one site; fukushima daiichi has 6 and plans to build two more there. this makes them obvious targets for a “common mode” failure such as loss of off-site power and flooding of sources of emergency power, increasing the danger six-fold. had the facilities been required to disperse their plants, at some small economic penalty, earthquake and tsunami risks would be greatly reduced.

the silver lining? regulators now say they will use lessons from the disaster at fukushima to improve nuclear plant safety. on march 12 the american nuclear society noted the dire events, but continuing the tradition of risk analysis in the industry reassured us: in an event like this, “containing the radioactive materials could actually be considered a ‘success’ given the scale of this natural disaster that had not been considered in the original design. the nuclear power industry will learn from this event, and redesign our facilities as needed to make them safer in the future.” in our disasters is our salvation.

how did such a property crop up in oak glen, a tiny pocket (population 638) in san bernardino county that’s about an hour and a half from los angeles?

the owner visited europe, was inspired by a castle there and built a replica out of cut gray stone, according to listing broker jr allgower. the owner started construction in 1976 and only finished a few years ago.

“his goal was always to live in a castle, to be the king of a castle,” allgower tells the post. “it’s taken him a while to get it all together.”

over the 7-acre estate, there’s also an apple orchard, grape vines and cherry blossom trees. it also abuts the san bernardino national forest.

“there are deer, bobcats, bears — so it’s completely enclosed now,” allgower adds. “there are wrought-iron gates around it.” whew!

the interior has modern conveniences (except for central heat and air conditioning) but the decor is medievally inspired — hence the two fireplaces and a tapestry hanging in the great room.

there are also four two-car garages that the owner has dubbed “stables.”

marshall said in a facebook post that police raided the bangkok family home of his wife noppawan “ploy” bunluesilp, 38, which she was visiting with the couple’s 3-year-old son. ploy and her father were taken in temporarily for questioning friday morning, he said, adding in a later update that his wife had been released.

thitirat nongharnpitak, commander of central investigation bureau, confirmed the detentions to agence france-presse, and said a laptop, ipad and documents were also seized. he also linked the questioning directly to unflattering photographs of thailand’s crown prince maha vajiralongkorn published this week by german tabloid bild, which marshall has shared on social media.

thitirat insisted the photographs were “doctored,” and said marshall was responsible. “the culprit is andrew macgregor marshall who has violated lèse-majesté laws for several years,” he said, according to afp. formerly based in bangkok, the journalist has written extensively about the monarchy’s recent history and authored the 2014 book on the subject, a kingdom in crisis, which is banned in thailand.

marshall insists his wife is not involved in his journalism. “i have always ensured that i work completely independently of her, both because of the risks and because she has her own views on thai politics and does not share mine,” he wrote on facebook. “there is no reason for police to detain her.”

the iowa capital is the country's third best city for children. the metro area has the nation's 17th highest high school graduation rate at 89%. the best performing public school district in the area is the johnston community school district. 92% of students in johnston's public schools tested as proficient in math.

this nebraska city rates extremely well for environmental quality and children's health. it is also generally a very affordable place to live. according to data from the u.s. census bureau, the median home value in lincoln is less than $150,000. that's good news for budget-conscious parents who want to buy an affordable home with plenty of space for the little ones to run wild.

according to data from the harvard ""equality of opportunity"" project, children in rochester, minnesota enjoy the highest level of economic mobility of any major metropolitan area in the u.s. while parents should love the idea that their children have a great chance of economic ascension in rochester, kids in med city have a reason to rejoice as well.

smartasset's research found that 35 out of every 1,000 businesses in the rochester area are kid-friendly entertainment venues. that's the seventh highest concentration of any major u.s. city. according to the u.s. census bureau, the area is home to nine bowling alleys and two arcades.

a child's health and safety is the top concern for most parents and on that front the norwich metro area, which includes the city of new london, rates very well. the area's child mortality rate ranks among the ten lowest in the u.s.

on average, schools in the bridgeport metro area (which includes stamford and norwalk) rate very well, with graduation rates of near 90% and proficiency in math and reading over 80%. in the norwalk school district, for example, 85% of students graduate from high school, 82% of students are proficient in math and 78% are proficient in language arts.

one exception to this is the bridgeport public school district, which is the largest district in the region. proficiency in the bridgeport school district is around 50% in both reading and math, while the graduation rate is 67%. thus, while the metro area as a whole rates well for children, it is important to consider where exactly in the area your children will attend school.

over the past decade and a half, the unemployment rate in fargo has remained several percentage points lower than the national average. that isn't just good for working adults, it also benefits children. thanks in part to the economic opportunities provided by the strong regional economy, fargo ranks third in the country for economic mobility and has the 12th lowest child poverty rate.

the area has nine bowling alleys, four arcades and one of the country's best minor league baseball venues. that adds up to the fifth highest concentration of kid-friendly entertainment options of any major metro area.

though york itself is quite small, with a population just over 40,000, the metro area has 437,000 people according to the u.s. census bureau. the region's schools rate especially well, with a graduation rate of 90% and high levels of proficiency in math and reading.

to find the best cities for children, smartasset looked at data on children's health, education and quality of life in every u.s. metro area with a population greater than 200,000 people. we considered 13 factors in all, as described below.

to gauge the schools in a metro area, we looked at the metro-wide graduation rate, weighting each school district's graduation rate based on the size of the student body. we also considered the percentage of students proficient in math and the percentage of students proficient in reading and language arts.

next, we looked at data on health and environmental factors. we considered the infant mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 births) and child mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 children age 18 or younger). we looked at the percentage of children that do not have health insurance in each metro. to gauge environmental quality, we considered each metro's average epa air quality index rating for the year 2014. we also looked at the frequency of water quality violations in each metro.

lastly, we considered several economic and quality-of-life metrics. we looked at the child poverty rate in each metro and the intergenerational mobility (a measure of economic opportunity created by researchers at harvard). to gauge the cost of living and cost of raising a child in each metro, we looked at the median home value. we also considered the percentage of each metro's population that is under the age of 20 and the number of kid-friendly entertainment establishments per 1,000 businesses in each metro area.

after gathering the data, we ranked every metro on each of the thirteen factors. we then averaged those rankings. the two environmental factors received half-weight and all other factors received full weight. finally, we indexed that average, with scores ranging from 0 to 100. the metro with the best ranking received a 100.

data on the graduation rate, math proficiency and reading proficiency in each metro comes from the u.s. department of education. data on the infant mortality rate, child mortality rate, percentage of children without insurance and water quality comes from countyhealthrankings.org.

data on the population percentage of children, the poverty rate, the concentration of entertainment establishments and the median home value come from the u.s. census bureau. data on the average air quality comes from the epa. data on the intergenerational mobility in each city comes from harvard's equality of opportunity project.

hollywood - jason lee's story sounds too good to be true. seven years ago, he was a 23-year-old professional skateboarder growing bored with his sport. so he said to himself, ""i like movies. wouldn't it be interesting to play characters?""

""i didn't know anything about acting,"" he says, laughing at his innocence. ""i just tried it on a whim because it seemed like it would be fun.""

it worked. lee's first audition was for independent film maker kevin smith, who cast him as a slacker in ""mallrats"" opposite shannen doherty, then as ben affleck's pal banky in ""chasing amy."" he hasn't stopped working since, including a star-making performance as an insecure rock singer in ""almost famous.""

lee has five movies opening this year. next month, he begins his first leading role in the comedy ""stealing stanford."" right now, he's making the next tom cruise vehicle, ""vanilla sky.""

first up is ""heartbreakers,"" opening tomorrow. in this romantic farce, about mother-daughter grifters played by sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt, lee plays a bartender who falls in love with a young woman trying to set him up for a con. but the con goes wrong when the thief falls in love with her prey.

""the cool thing about jack is that he's really intelligent,"" lee says. ""he sees right through them. he's very sweet and very understanding and forgiving. he likes the idea of doing the right thing and enjoying life. i'm like that, as opposed to the very cynical smart a---s i've played in other movies.""

in person, lee is a sleepy, laid-back guy. on three hours of sleep following an all-night shoot on ""vanilla sky,"" he's sitting on a beverly hills hotel balcony, rubbing his eyes, chugging bottles of water and talking about the road that got him here.

""i was determined to become a professional skateboarder, and i worked very hard at it, and it happened,"" he says. ""that was fun and fulfilling, but then i started becoming less passionate about it. a year after i made 'mallrats,' i retired from skateboarding, very determined to become the best actor i could be. i wanted to get better and more confident and have a good time with it.""

if stardom comes, he's ready to avoid the pitfalls.

""people are surprised that i'm not the typical young hollywood actor,"" he says. ""i'm not a wild man. i dealt with that as a skateboarder - being young and having money and being on tours and taking advantage of all that stuff.""

lee started boarding early, growing up in huntington beach in southern california. ""in school, i was hyper and goofy,"" he says. ""i did my own thing and had a good time. but because i was funny at school, all the nonskaters, jock types and cheerleaders liked me.""

lee's skateboard prowess brought him money, his own company and product lines bearing his name. he met his wife of six years, actress-photographer carmen llywellyn, at an action-sports trade show.

""it was fortunate that i experienced pressure and limelight,"" he says of his athletic days. ""i learned how to be professional at something and manage money. that definitely helped in this new adventure of mine."""

hollywood - they come by car, by plane, by bus. some struggle for years for a paycheck, while others get their break almost immediately.

what's the secret of making it in hollywood? a pretty face or a buffed physique won't hurt. ""'leading man' is the ultimate category i want to be in,"" says one young hopeful, ""but it's the most difficult to get the breaks in. the name 'marc blucas' doesn't greenlight a film.""

actress kerry washington insists that hard work is ""a fraction of what it takes to be a survivor in this industry. it makes me laugh when people say my success happened overnight. after shooting 'save the last dance,' i went back to work in a restaurant for six months.""

a tv series can help sometimes, although ""two guys and a girl's"" ryan reynolds complains: ""i felt like a greyhound not being able to run. i couldn't begin to do what i'm capable of doing, although people got to sample some of my stuff.""

auditions are crucial. paul bettany, an emerging british star, auditioned for a film that never got made, but its director wrote him a key role in ""a knight's tale."" auditions on tape were the secret for both dagmara dominczyk and orlando bloom, while sports skills helped kelly hu and kate bosworth get noticed.

there's no yellow brick road to stardom in hollywood, but every year a few new faces draw attention. here are eight up-and-comers who are generating that indefinable quality known as ""buzz.""

a 19-year-old from l.a., kate bosworth takes the risky step of donning a bikini for her role in this summer's ""surf girls.""

""it's a girl's worst nightmare,"" she says, sounding embarrassed at first. ""but my character's a strong, independent woman who's athletic and muscular, not a waif. it's a good message to send to young women.""

four years ago, robert redford picked the then-eighth-grade champion equestrian to play a supporting role in ""the horse whisperer."" she has acted sporadically since (""remember the titans,"" ""young americans""), but decided a few months ago to delay her acceptance to princeton for a year to see if she could forge a film career.

""my priorities are different from a lot of young people,"" she says. ""partying and clubbing sound alluring, but it's not me. i'm driven, and i work hard. i really wanted 'surf girls,' though i didn't know how to surf. so i started learning in malibu two weeks before i got the part. my instructor said i had the knack.""

the same with acting, apparently. ""robert redford told me not to take classes,"" she adds. ""he said i had a natural ability.""

""my dad is very dramatic, and from him i learned to be passionate,"" says dagmara dominczyk. ""he has no qualms about disagreeing with 20 people.""

twenty years ago, poland's then-communist government jailed her politician father. a year later, the dominczyks came to america as political refugees. ""we lived in the projects in brooklyn,"" says the 25-year-old actress. she discovered acting when she accompanied a friend - who didn't want to take the subway to manhattan alone - on an audition.

""i'd never read a play and hardly went to the movies,"" she says. ""i thought actors were pretty people on tv. but i picked some monologues, auditioned and got in [to drama school at carnegie mellon university on a full scholarship].""

after understudying in the broadway production of ""closer,"" she won her first sizable film role as the sultry pr woman in ""rock star.""

""the character was supposed to be hot,"" she says, ""so i gave myself a sexy massage on tape. when they got it, they immediately flew me to hollywood for an audition.""

dominczyk will play the heroine, mercedes, in the latest remake of ""the count of monte cristo,"" opening in february.

""i had to show i was vulnerable and emotional,"" she says. ""it was a pretty weepy audition. i had to be bold from the inside."" she will also appear in ""they,"" a thriller due in april.

""i remember, at 4, telling my mother that i was going to los angeles to be a superstar,"" says kelly hu. thirty years later, after a roundabout route of beauty pageants and martial arts, she is at least working in the right business. in april, hu can be seen playing the hostage of an evil egyptian warlord in ""the scorpion king,"" a prequel to ""the mummy returns"" that has been designed as a vehicle for dwayne (the rock) johnson.

a modeling agent discovered hu at 13 in a honolulu shopping mall but her mother wouldn't let her start working until she was 16.

""my agent told me if i were to get a title, they could promote me better,"" she says, ""so i won the 1985 miss usa teen pageant."" her winnings enabled her to move to l.a.

""most of the early roles i was up for were vietnam war stories,"" hu says, ""but now it seems hollywood is willing to look at asians for all types of roles. 'the scorpion king' wanted someone who looked very different and exotic. i was one of the few asian women who went in.

""they didn't know i used to be called 'the king fu chick,'"" she says of her brown belt in karate, which came in handy for the ""martial law"" series a few years ago. ""when they found out, they added some shots of me fighting.""

""there are so few good roles available to young people, females and blacks,"" says 26-year-old kerry washington, ""and i'm all three. yet i've played such an enormous range of parts."" they include lady macbeth (at collegiate), a shoplifter in the unreleased ""lift"" and an inner-city teen in ""save the last dance.""

reared in the bronx, washington began acting professionally at 13 with the education theater company, then based at st. luke's hospital. her roles addressed sex education and self-esteem.

""i performed for the hardest audience - teenagers,"" she says. ""it was during the aids epidemic, and i was on stage telling them to use condoms.""

after graduating from george washington university, she made her film debut two years ago in ""our song."" this year she can be seen as chris rock's girlfriend in the spy comedy ""bad company"" and as a heroin addict in ""sin,"" which stars gary oldman and ving rhames.

""the ['sin'] director felt he needed someone smart and emotionally stable, willing to take big artistic risks,"" says washington. ""i think i bring to the table a lot of emotional truth and commitment.""

a blond, 30-year-old londoner, paul bettany is best known to american audiences for his comic (and often naked) turn as geoffrey chaucer in ""a knight's tale"" and as russell crowe's hearty roommate in ""a beautiful mind."" but he has already played leads in british films, and his portrayal of the icy gangland lieutenant who betrays his mentor in ""gangster no. 1"" - due here this spring - earned him comparisons with the young michael caine.

ambitious though he is, the principled bettany turned down one high-profile role. six months ago, he promised lars von trier that he would appear in the danish director's ""dogville,"" with nicole kidman and lauren bacall.

""then,"" he says, ""i got offered 'red dragon' [the latest hannibal lecter drama]. that would have been my payday. it's a helluva thing to miss. but movies are a world where people don't have to keep promises, and i'll be darned if i'll be one of those people yet."" (ralph fiennes took the ""red dragon"" part.)

although he grew up in an acting family, bettany used to sing and play guitar on the streets for a living. ""i love writing songs,"" he says. ""but i hate playing them in front of people because they're in the first person, and i don't want anyone to know anything about me.""

he decided acting was his true calling and went to drama school at age 20, making his west end debut in ""an inspector calls"" and breaking into films with ""bent"" in 1997.

""i was quite fearless as a kid,"" says orlando bloom, who is playing legolas in the three ""lord of the rings"" films. ""but i've had to realize i'm not invincible. that's what breaking your back does. it makes you grow up and reassess life.""

three years ago, when bloom was 21, he fell three floors while trying to open the jammed door of a friend's apartment.

""i wasn't meant to walk again,"" he recalls, ""but i had a miraculous recovery."" (ironically, he's the fresh-faced rookie whose fall from a helicopter precipitates the ferocious somali attack on american forces in ""black hawk down."")

born in canterbury, england, bloom quit school at 16 and moved to london to be an actor. ""i never responded to teaching,"" he says. ""i was more interested in what was happening on the playing fields.""

after his accident, he realized he needed ""some kind of education,"" so he went to drama school. then ""lord of the rings"" director peter jackson cast him as the agile archer elf.

bloom has deliberately avoided teen films, he says. ""i want to do work that has a message and casts a light over an area that's dark. but i'm fun and jovial, too. i bungee-jump, skydive, surf and snowboard. i still try to be fearless.""

as long as tom cruise, matt damon and brad pitt are snagging all the roles for handsome leading men, 6-foot-3-inch marc blucas reckons he'll have to be content with supporting parts. ""i'll never even be cast as the best friend because i'm physically bigger than [most] lead [actors],"" he says with a sigh.

a wake forest basketball star who played professionally in europe for a year, blucas, from girard, pa., gave up a law school scholarship because he became passionate about acting. ""it was a little shocking to my parents,"" he says, though they might have guessed something was up when they saw their son play a marshmallow in ""hansel and gretel"" in third grade.

he moved to los angeles five years ago and eventually scored a two-day part in ""pleasantville"" that extended to eight weeks. ""that was the verification i needed,"" he says. ""then a year and a half on 'buffy the vampire slayer' put me on the map.""

blucas, who turns 30 on friday, should edge his way toward bigger roles this year after audiences see him in the mel gibson vietnam war drama ""we were soldiers,"" the gwyneth paltrow romantic comedy ""a view from the top"" and as part of the ensemble in director john sayles' florida expose, ""sunshine state.""

""my family is as strait-laced as they come,"" says ryan reynolds, 25, who broke the mold to become a comedy actor. ""my dad was a cop and my brother just became a royal canadian mounted policeman. for me, it's been an unending source of comedy material.""

a regular on the now-defunct ""two guys and a girl,"" reynolds grew up admiring steve martin, chevy chase, jack lemmon and jerry lewis. ten years ago, even though he didn't make the audition cutoffs at his junior high, he talked his way onto nickelodeon's ""fifteen.""

he finds humor everywhere, even in ""being picked on at school,"" he says. ""whatever causes you to cultivate other parts of your personality is good. the best comedy training i ever had was working the graveyard shift at a [vancouver] grocery store for a year after high school,"" when he temporarily quit acting. ""we wasted a lot of fruit, beaning each other with guavas and mangoes for eight hours.""

it has all become grist for his leading role in march's upcoming ""national lampoon's van wilder,"" in which, he says proudly, ""i make a complete and utter jackass of myself,"" and another spring comedy, ""buying the cow."""

monday, may 17th 1999, 2:10am

the nypd's campaign to recruit more city residents hits the airwaves today, with a series of up-close-and-personal tv spots featuring cops and citizens.

""our job isn't just about enforcing the laws and locking people up,"" says sgt. lino minetto of the 115th precinct in jackson heights, queens. the camera is in tight on his face, a soulful beat plays softly in the background.

""we're human beings with a superhuman job,"" he says. ""we're just here to help you . . . we're here for you. you're where we work. you're our job.""

the 30-second spot and six others like it produced for free by the soho-based arnell group begin airing today on local tv stations. they will be followed by more tv ads, radio and print ads and posters on buses and subways.

but even before a single ad aired, they were the focus of controversy, with the rev. al sharpton and assemblyman ruben diaz jr. (d-bronx) blasting the city for not buying airtime from the city's black and latino radio stations. deputy police commissioner marilyn mode called the charge ""flat-out wrong.""

police commissioner howard safir said last week that the goal of the $10 million media blitz is two-fold: to recruit more city residents to the force and heal the relations between police and city residents strained by the amadou diallo shooting.

""i think they will go a long way toward bringing together the people of this city, and getting us the kind of candidates we want,"" safir said after watching the spots.

one ad depicts the emotional response of a hard-boiled police commander, deputy inspector joseph reznick, to the murder of a young girl. one shows closeups of a domestic violence victim and the detective who arrested her husband.

another features detective wally salem, saved by his bulletproof vest when he was shot by a drug dealer at point-blank range in 1997. and one focuses on minetto and 7-year-old jeannette duran, whose life he saved by rushing her to the hospital in his patrol car after her leg was severed by a truck last march.

the cops used in the spots were culled from 300 cases looked at by peter arnell, chairman of the agency responsible for eye-catching campaigns for dkny, tommy hilfiger and movado.

the 40-year-old sheepshead bay, brooklyn, native said he offered to do the spots free because he wanted to give something back to the city.

he insisted the campaign isn't ""advertising,"" but an effort to depict reality.

safir said nine other ad firms that bid on the job were asking in the range of $1 million. all of the savings will be spent on the campaign, he said.

the campaign was announced in late february in part to respond to criticism in the wake of the diallo shooting that the police department does not reflect the community.

of 40,000 officers in the nypd, 67% are white, 17.5% are hispanic and 13.5% are black. the remainder are asian and american indian. the city population is about 38% white, 26% black and 26% hispanic.

sharpton said the campaign is clearly aimed at recruiting minorities but does not use minority media outlets.

""we do not feel it is in any way fair. . . . or prudent that you do not use minority media in a minority recruitment drive,"" sharpton said at the canaan baptist church on w. 116th st.in harlem.

sharpton said he met friday with executives at such minority-targeted media outlets as wbls (107.5 fm), wlib (1190 am) and la mega (97.9 fm) radio stations, and newspapers including el diario, the daily challenge, and the new york amsterdam news. sharpton said none had been approached by the city to book advertising time or space.

""the time hasn't been purchased yet,"" mode responded, ""but i absolutely know that we specifically plan to hit all the major ethnic radio stations and papers.""

in devising the campaign, mode noted the nypd consulted the urban league, 100 blacks in law enforcement and the rev. calvin butts of harlem's abyssinian baptist church.

mode said butts and the groups focus on the positive. ""this is al sharpton once again trying to be divisive,"" she said."

michael douglas and catherine zeta-jones are making the spanish isle of majorca hotter than usual this summer. we told you last week that the ""entrapment"" beauty was headed to see douglas, who has a cliffside mansion there. and, as predicted, they've been courting on the golf course.

when not on the links, the duo has been sailing on a yacht - and that's where the spanish magazine interviu reportedly snapped photos of them. zeta was caught ""playfully baring her breasts and lying across michael's chest,"" says london's star tabloid in a story headlined ""zeta's topless romp!""

no wonder michael's father, kirk, who was quite a swordsman in his day, is said by friends to be a big fan of zeta-jones.

of course, the romance is still new. ""michael runs hot and cold,"" one source tells us. ""i don't think anybody's talking marriage. but she's certainly the it girl now.""

douglas' reps says simply: ""they are dating and very happy.""

leonardo dicaprio may have an offer hollywood can't refuse. or he may not.

according to the hollywood reporter, the ""titanic"" star is talking with director francis ford coppola and writer mario puzo about starring in a fourth installment of ""the godfather."" the young hunk reportedly would play the young sonny corleone, first brought to life by james caan.

but dicaprio's rep, cindy guagenti, cautions us: ""this is all very premature. there's no script and no deal.""

coppola's rep also says, ""francis says he has no plans to film a part four. he's deeply enmeshed in an original screenplay. paramount could make the movie without him. i don't know whether anyone would come to see it.""

this is the second hoodlum role that dicaprio has fancied this year. he has also been talking with martin scorsese about co-starring with robert de niro in the antique crime saga ""gangs of new york."" some reports claimed that dicaprio had vowed never again to take part in screen violence after his ""basketball diaries"" was linked to the columbine shootings. but it now seems like he's dying to be a made man.

jon bon jovi gave his all for doug flutie last weekend. the rocker let the buffalo bill use his new mansion in middletown, n.j., for a benefit for flutie's autism foundation. the big-hearted bon jovi must be feeling flush after selling his rumson, n.j. spread for around $1.25 million because he and his band agreed to auction off two performances ""at your barbecue, bar mitzvah or wedding."" two guests paid $60,000 each for gigs.

new york (reuters life!) - not all carbs are created equal

in ""the lean belly prescription,"" travis stork, an urgent-care physician in tennessee and the host of the tv daytime talk show ""the doctors"" and peter moore, the editor of ""men's health"" magazine, focus on losing excessive abdominal, or belly fat. ""the concept of 'the lean belly prescription' is good protein, good carbs and enjoying the foods you love. (reporting by patricia reaney; editing by paul casciato)","new york | tue dec 28, 2010 5:59am est

new york (reuters life!) - if living without pasta and bread, or giving up cheese and bacon make losing weight difficult, the latest diet books may provide some incentive to drop that added holiday weight.

instead of deprivation, restricting food groups or counting calories, new weight loss plans offer different approaches to slimming without feeling hungry.

""it's really a diet that brings food back on to the plate that people thought they were not allowed to eat,"" said ellen kunes, the editor-in-chief of health magazine and a co-author with dietician and nutrition expert frances largeman-roth of ""the carblovers diet.""

unlike other weight-loss plans that restrict carbohydrates, at least initially, the core of the carblovers diet is carbs and resistant starch, an ingredient in bananas, oatmeal, beans and lentils, wholegrain pasta, barley, brown rice, peas, polenta, potato chips and rye and pumpernickel bread -- foods the authors have been dubbed ""carbstars.""

""it acts like a fiber in the body and it does not get absorbed in the small intestine, and also at the same time it triggers fat-burning enzymes and helps to feel fuller,"" kunes explained about resistant starch.

the 28-day diet includes a kickstart phase with carb-filled recipes totaling 1200 calories a day, followed by a 21-day immersion plan during which foods such as steak, french toast and chocolates are reintroduced.

followers of the diet lost up to six pounds in the first week and 50 pounds over five months, according to the authors.

""the best thing you can do is to incorporate good carbs back on to your plate and that is the secret to losing weight and keeping it off,"" said kunes.

not all carbs are created equal

in ""the lean belly prescription,"" travis stork, an urgent-care physician in tennessee and the host of the tv daytime talk show ""the doctors"" and peter moore, the editor of ""men's health"" magazine, focus on losing excessive abdominal, or belly fat.

""it's that visceral belly fat that hugs your internal organs, causing diabetes, increasing your risk of stroke and even cancers,"" stork said in an interview.

""the concept of 'the lean belly prescription' is good protein, good carbs and enjoying the foods you love. with simple tweeks you can eat the food you love and still lose weight.""

with his pick 3 to lean plan stork helps readers cut out nutritionally empty food and replace it with healthier version of the same food.

coupled with moderate exercise stork said the four-week plan will result in a lean belly and weight loss of as much as 15 pounds in a month.

"few things are more ephemeral than the picture postcard. so let’s hear it for ephemerality, since few shows this year are likely to offer more in the way of enchantment than “the postcard age: selections from the leonard a. lauder collection.” it runs at the museum of fine arts through april 14. pleasure, as well as postage, is guaranteed. the craze receded, as crazes do, aided in no small measure by world war i. but the popularity (and stylishness) of postcards remained strong enough that the postcard age continued for another two decades. a commercial item, postcards were made to be sold. because of their size, postcard designs had to be clear, straightforward, and (relatively) simple. sometimes the image is a photograph, more often a lithograph. frames contain multiple postcards, as few as two, as many as a dozen. to categorize postcards during this era is to categorize society, really, they offer such a window on social history. similarly, menus on the red star line of cruise ships had a detachable top half that could be mailed.","few things are more ephemeral than the picture postcard. so let’s hear it for ephemerality, since few shows this year are likely to offer more in the way of enchantment than “the postcard age: selections from the leonard a. lauder collection.” it runs at the museum of fine arts through april 14.

lauder is chairman emeritus of the estée lauder cosmetics empire (the namesake founder was his mother). the postcard has not lacked for distinguished admirers, from the poet paul eluard to the photographer walker evans. but lauder has been acquirer as well as admirer, putting his money, and storage space, where his passion is. a demon collector, he has donated 160,000 of his acquisitions to the mfa. that figure is an estimate. with something so seemingly inconsequential as postcards, it’s hard to come by a precise count.

note that “seemingly,” though. the 700 or so examples that are on display in “the postcard age” are almost without exception aesthetically pleasing, historically illuminating, or both. there are also a few books and posters. the show is smart, fun, lively, unpretentious, and wonderfully informative. pleasure, as well as postage, is guaranteed. the mfa’s benjamin weiss, who curated the show with lydia klich, likens the selection to “a tasting menu.” so think of “the postcard age” as particularly delectable postal tapas.

the postcard era began in 1869, when the austro-hungarian empire authorized the delivery of prepaid mail without envelopes. thus was born the postcard. soon enough illustrations began to appear on one side, and the postcard as we know it had arrived. such was the postcard’s popularity that it isn’t all that much of an exaggeration to describe it as fin-de-siècle e-mail: a form of casual communication so often turned to as to be effectively indispensable. the exhibition’s website (www.mfa.org/exhibitions/postcard-age) allows users to e-mail a selection of postcards from the show.

the years between 1895 and 1915 experienced a postcard craze. in 1903, a billion postcards were sent through the german postal system. some of the most amusing items in “the postcard age” are postcards not about people or places or any of the usual things we associate with postcards, but postcards about (yes) postcards. a woman can be seen in a postcard from around 1904 wearing a very fancy hat and holding up a sign that bears the words “la carte postale entrient l’amitie”: “the postcard maintains friendship.” yes, it does.

the craze receded, as crazes do, aided in no small measure by world war i. but the popularity (and stylishness) of postcards remained strong enough that the postcard age continued for another two decades. world war ii, followed by television and inexpensive travel and increasingly widespread color reproduction in print media, put an end to the age — though not, of course, to postcards.

within these trim, unyielding rectangles, small miracles of imagination could be achieved. a commercial item, postcards were made to be sold. they did so by catching the eye and being attractive. attractiveness can take many forms: elegance, comedy, familiarity, innovativeness, raciness (yes, there are a few examples of postcards in the ooh-la-la mode). because of their size, postcard designs had to be clear, straightforward, and (relatively) simple. the artful use of blocks of color recurs throughout the show. sometimes the image is a photograph, more often a lithograph. sometimes the image is black and white, more often color (likelier to catch the eye). often the card bears type, and the variety of fonts in “the postcard age” is an exhibition unto itself.

it’s in the nature of postcards that their creators are usually anonymous. this can make them all the more useful as an index of change in graphic design. usually anonymous, but not always. the vienna secession, in 1898, and the bauhaus, in 1923, promoted themselves by issuing postcards. it’s an art-historical lagniappe to see a josef hoffmann design featured on a postcard here, or one by lyonel feininger or wassily kandinsky.

even the most appealing postcard can’t do much good undelivered. virginia durruty, the exhibition’s designer, has provided an irreproachable delivery service. comprising so many items, the show must have been a bear to hang. but the layout is so inviting and legible as to seem inevitable. frames contain multiple postcards, as few as two, as many as a dozen. the frames are angled out along temporary walls or on the gallery walls proper. the arrangement simultaneously accommodates such a large number of images and breaks them up into manageable groups.

to categorize postcards during this era is to categorize society, really, they offer such a window on social history. some of the categories klich and weiss offer include paris, fashion, celebrity, travel, world war i (some of the propaganda uses to which postcards were put are startling), sports, and the postcard craze. along the way, much is to be learned. who knew that the michelin man has a name (bibendum) or that it derives from an ode by the roman poet horace (the name’s upshot being, “now’s the time for a drink”).

most of the cards are in mint condition, never having been mailed. one exception shows a photograph of a group outside of les halles, the paris produce market. the sender affixed the postage in such a way that a woman seems to be holding the stamp in her hands. makers could be no less clever. an all-access pass to the 1900 paris universal exposition had a detachable portion that could be sent as a postcard. similarly, menus on the red star line of cruise ships had a detachable top half that could be mailed. postcards produced by a paris wallpaper company in 1925 do quadruple duty: as card, as ad, as design sample, and as attractive image in its own right."
"new york — a corner apartment in harlem: air conditioning on high against the blazing heat outside, african art objects and concert posters on the walls, incense wafting through the living room. this is the temporary command post of diblo dibala, congolese bandleader and guitarist extraordinaire, as he readies for a one-month north american tour spreading the gospel of soukous, one of the most compelling and contagiously rump-shaking styles of music ever invented, yet one rarely performed in these parts nowadays. musicians stop by, make coffee, log on to the computer. like many congolese artists, dibala, who founded iconic groups loketo in the 1980s and matchatcha in 1990, has long lived in paris, where work conditions are vastly better than back home. others come from cameroon, nigeria, kenya. “there aren’t as many people anymore who make soukous,” dibala says. “ from their base in paris, loketo and others had less use for long lingala lyrics that many in their audience wouldn’t understand. the stagnation back home exasperates him, as does the endless war for resources in africa’s great lakes region, which has engulfed eastern congo in a spiral of conflict and atrocities.","new york — a corner apartment in harlem: air conditioning on high against the blazing heat outside, african art objects and concert posters on the walls, incense wafting through the living room.

this is the temporary command post of diblo dibala, congolese bandleader and guitarist extraordinaire, as he readies for a one-month north american tour spreading the gospel of soukous, one of the most compelling and contagiously rump-shaking styles of music ever invented, yet one rarely performed in these parts nowadays.

musicians stop by, make coffee, log on to the computer. like many congolese artists, dibala, who founded iconic groups loketo in the 1980s and matchatcha in 1990, has long lived in paris, where work conditions are vastly better than back home. but he has a parallel crew here, among new york’s large pool of african talent, who back him at his us shows, including friday night at boston’s bastille day party on marlborough street.

one is ngouma lokito, superstar bass player from another essential 1980s band, soukous stars, now based here. others come from cameroon, nigeria, kenya. they include the female dancers without whose dexterous moves, heavily focused on hips and rear end, no self-respecting soukous show is complete.

“i might have to settle here,” says dibala, 58, in french. “people in the us still have fun the right way.”

this contrasts with europe, where, he says, the economic doldrums have people withdrawing into their shell. meanwhile the democratic republic of congo, where he made his name as a guitar wizard in the 1970s, is prey to authoritarian rule in the capital, war in the east, poor infrastructure, and a corrupt atmosphere.

“musicians back home are singing praises of governors and ministers just to get money,” dibala says. “that isn’t real music!”

most of all, soukous — in which songs open in rumba tempo, with lyrics in the elegant lingala language, then accelerate and erupt into dazzling guitar polyrhythms in a section known as the sebene — is itself a victim of changing times.

twenty years ago it was arguably the dominant african pop music, heard in bars and taxis from abidjan to nairobi, and in hip clubs frequented by africans overseas. many soukous players of that time are now scattered, often struggling. younger artists de-emphasize the guitar in favor of bass, synths, and effects. nigerian hip-hop, angolan kuduro, ivorian coupé-décalé are among the blunter new genres with continental sway.

“there aren’t as many people anymore who make soukous,” dibala says. “and yet it’s one of the greatest styles of music congo possesses.”

dibala himself was one of the music’s innovators in his time. with loketo in the early 1980s, he helped pioneer a style that abbreviated the slow rumba section that the great earlier bands, led by the likes of franco and tabu ley rochereau, so relished.

the new style was to get quickly to the sebene — and keep accelerating. from their base in paris, loketo and others had less use for long lingala lyrics that many in their audience wouldn’t understand. they reduced these and added more “animation” — calls and exhortations to hype the crowd higher and higher.

“i added my stone to the edifice,” dibala says. “when i solo, it’s faster, higher notes — to touch people and make them dance.”

he’s not insensitive to new tastes: “you have to adapt to the time you live in,” he says. “we have some synths, for example. i change things up a little, but i remain myself. without my guitar, it wouldn’t be me.”

he has also started playing some folk songs from his home region, kasai, both in soukous versions and in traditional style.

a conversation with dibala naturally turns to politics. the stagnation back home exasperates him, as does the endless war for resources in africa’s great lakes region, which has engulfed eastern congo in a spiral of conflict and atrocities.

last year’s election that incumbent president joseph kabila won was widely seen as flawed. “it wasn’t even an election,” dibala says. when change comes, he says, he would love to organize a big concert in kinshasa featuring all the soukous diaspora.

until then, he’ll keep playing overseas, sharing a sound that, for all its travails, never fails to prove its relevance where it counts: on the dance floor.

“wherever we go, people acclaim us for this music,” dibala says. “soukous is still here.”"

the drug, omalizumab, known by its brand name, xolair, is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat allergic asthma. in the phase 3 trial, published online sunday in the new england journal of medicine, a monthly injection of the drug significantly reduced hives and itchiness.

“this is the magic bullet that patients have been waiting for for the last 40 years,’’ said dr. marcus maurer, the lead author of the study and a professor of dermatology and allergy at charite-universitaetsmedizin in berlin.

maurer has received consulting fees from several drug companies, including genentech and novartis, which financed the study and are developing the drug.

dr. jonathan bernstein, a professor of medicine and an allergy specialist at the university of cincinnati, who was not associated with the study, said that it was well designed and that the results were encouraging.

“the drug is not a cure, but it will advance our ability to manage these patients,’’ he said.

if approved, omalizumab could bring relief to those who suffer from chronic idiopathic urticaria, which for unknown reasons causes hives, itchiness, and often the swelling of lips, tongue, and other soft tissues. the symptoms can last for months or often years.

studies suggest that 1 in 1,000 people suffer from the condition, though some experts believe that estimate is low. currently, only nonsedating antihistamines are approved to treat it, and fewer than half of the patients respond to these drugs when prescribed at the approved dosage.

if treatment fails, doctors increase the dosage up to four times the licensed dose. or they prescribe off-label medications, including steroids and immunosuppressant drugs, which come with a risk of serious side effects.

thirty to 50 percent of patients do not respond to any treatment. ‘‘these patients are miserable, left with welts over their body,’’ bernstein said. ‘‘it can be quite debilitating.’’

in the study, researchers enrolled 323 patients with moderate to severe chronic idiopathic hives who did not respond to antihistamines. participants were randomly assigned to receive a monthly injection of 75 milligrams, 150 milligrams, or 300 milligrams of the drug, or a placebo for 12 weeks. they were followed for four months after treatment.

the group treated with 150 milligrams experienced a 57 percent reduction in itching, while those treated with 300 milligrams had a 71 percent reduction. the placebo group had a 37 percent reduction in itching. the group that received 75 milligrams had 41 percent less itching, which was not significant compared with the placebo group. the study participants who took the two higher doses also experienced less swelling, and the severity of their hives was reduced.

the drug is thought to deactivate immunoglobulin e (ige), an antibody that plays a crucial role in allergic response. these patients may have higher levels of ige, which binds to immune cells, signaling them to release proteins that cause allergic inflammation, said dr. karin rosen, a coauthor of the study and medical director for genentech."

unsurprisingly, mcbride offers solid renditions of well-known ballads like “if you don’t know me by now” and “i’ve been loving you too long,” the latter an intimate confessional. as gifted as she is, there is occasionally a reserved quality to her vocals and the production, with van morrison’s “wild night” not quite having the requisite boogie woogie.

the effects in moscow remains unclear, but senate republicans seemed quick to question why the u.s. isn’t being tougher on russia, even while sanctions targeted another seven individuals and 17 entities whose assets in the u.s. were ordered frozen. “without being overly partisan,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said, “i am deeply disappointed with the tepid response to russian aggression.”

mcconnell and others may have hoped for more, but sanctions are incredibly complicated, and america’s response is more strategic than critics might think.

the latest sanctions targets two of putin’s closest cronies who are the heads of two of the crown jewels of the russian economy: igor sechin, who’s the president and chairman of the management board of rosneft, russia’s leading petroleum company; and sergey chemezov, the director general of rostec, a large industrial conglomerate that includes weapons, cars, and metals. u.s. officials describe the sanctions as a slowly tightening noose around the russian leadership, including president vladimir putin. they believe they are conducting a calibrated attack against putin’s inner circle, allowing de-escalation if russia decides to back down, while keeping some economic weapons in reserve should russia take further escalatory steps, such as moving military forces across the ukrainian border. this calibration also ensures that u.s. and european efforts remain tightly coordinated, which is necessary if sanctions against russia are to be effective.

going forward, the bigger issue might be that no one really knows what the economic effects of broader sanctions will be – not just on russia, but also on the u.s. and global economy. those factors are likely what obama and german chancellor angela merkel are weighing, as the two leaders on friday warned that russia would face additional costs if moscow disrupts this month’s presidential elections in ukraine.

and as they continue discussing how to form the next round of sanctions, it’s worth understanding why careful calibration is appropriate. in recent years, sanctions have become america’s weapon of first resort. they have been used against dozens of countries, from burma to the central african republic to iran. in the case of iran, in particular, sanctions have been viewed as enormously effective, having nearly crippled the iranian economy and forced iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program at relatively little cost to the global economy.

senate republicans may think that if broader sanctions worked in iran, they could work in russia. however, administration officials understand that iran’s precedent tells us very little about russia.

more: how to fix the crazy competitive world of college admissions

true, u.s. officials contend that u.s. actions are already having a profound effect on russia’s economy. markets have priced in the possibility of further sanctions, and capital of over $60 billion has exited russia so far this year, exceeding outflows from last year. this has contributed to sharp declines in the russian stock market and russia’s currency, the ruble. on april 25, ratings agency standard & poor’s downgraded russia’s credit rating to bbb-, just one step above junk status. both putin and russian prime minister dmitri medvedev have admitted that the sanctions are having an effect, while the russian government has conceded that its economy will see little if any growth this year.

but the issue is not the effect of sanctions on russia — it is their potential effects on everyone else. the $2 trillion russian economy is bigger than the size of all other economies the u.s. has ever sanctioned combined. the russian economy, particularly its big banks, are deeply interwoven with the global economy and international financial system. russian commercial entities have tentacles everywhere from music venues in finland to sports teams in england to investment funds in switzerland, many of which are hard to map in advance.

for this reason, it is not simply that broader sanctions against russia will be expensive for the west; it is that no one knows how expensive they will be. and the dirty little secret of sanctions is that once they are deployed, they are very hard to undo as market actors will be reluctant to re-engage with the russian economy for fear of legal liability.

broader sanctions against russia would thus be a step into unknown territory, akin to allowing the lehman brother investment bank to fail in 2008. such a risky step might be necessary to defend the global order against russian lawlessness, but it is not to be taken lightly.

working the rooms was someone as irrepressible as ó muilleoir, a filmmaker and producer named kevin mccann. mccann was in mission mode, making contacts and looking for backers for a film that is more revolutionary than one might assume.

mccann is determined to make a movie about the easter rising of 1916, the pivotal moment in ireland’s independence movement. and he is pursuing it with special urgency, determined to have the film in theaters by next year, the rising’s centenary.

other films have touched on the rising, most notably neil jordan’s “michael collins” (1996) and ken loach’s “the wind that shakes the barley” (2006). but both of those films focused on the aftermath of the rising rather than the rising itself.

the irish people, in general, and irish popular culture in particular, tend to pay more attention to the war of independence and the ensuing civil war, which set the stage for political and cultural divisions that exist to this day.

the rising, its quixotic nature, and the tendency of more recent incarnations of irish rebels to portray themselves as the natural successors to the revolutionaries of 1916, makes it uncomfortable subject matter in many irish minds.

mccann shakes his head at this.

“can you imagine americans not wanting to talk about 1776?” he asked. “i think it’s to do with our relations with our british neighbors. maybe there’s a little embarrassment about celebrating the separation from the empire when relations are so good.”

but mccann believes that’s an argument exactly for doing what he wants to do.

“this is irish history. it would be an act of cultural delinquency to let the centenary pass without telling this story in the cinema. if this was any other country, there would have already been a dozen or more films made about every aspect of the rising. one of the reasons we don’t like to talk about the rising is because we don’t know it. we think we do, but most irish people are ignorant of the true story.”

jordan built his film around michael collins, who ignited civil war with his 1921 decision to accept the british compromise that essentially endorsed the partition of ireland and included an oath to the crown. mccann’s main protagonist is sean macdiarmada.

“before there was michael collins, there was sean macdiarmada,” he says.

macdiarmada was the mastermind of the rising. he was the last of the 16 rebels executed for their roles. those executions turned out to be a colossal tactical mistake by the british. before the executions, the rebels had been widely unpopular with the irish, many of whose loved ones were on the continent, fighting for the british army in world war i. the executions led to a backlash, and inspired others to join the war of independence that collins led after his release from prison for his role in the rising.

mccann met with the families of the seven signatories to the proclamation of an irish republic, and it was they who persuaded him that macdiarmada should be the protagonist of the film.

“his story is perfect for cinema,” mccann says. “a compelling, handsome fellow with an extraordinary intellect. to my shame, i had never heard of him. the reason why he is not remembered as much is, unlike padraig pearse or james connolly, he wasn’t a writer. he didn’t leave a record of his thoughts and movements. but he was the plotter, the mastermind of the whole revolution.”

beyond focusing on a patriot who never got his due, mccann wants to dispel the conventional wisdom surrounding the rising.

“one of the great myths is that they didn’t know what they were doing, that this was a military failure,” mccann said. “they had a very clear military strategy, and it worked. they perfected urban guerrilla warfare.”

it took british forces five days to end the siege, and the rising leaders’ main concern was to end the suffering of ordinary dubliners who were becoming collateral damage, mccann says.

macdiarmada was born in leitrim, the small, remote county in the northwest of ireland, which explains why leitrim county council has committed more than $11,000 to the film. a kickstarter campaign has brought in upward of $50,000, from 35 countries. mccann is using social media to build buzz and gain attention. there are more than 14,000 facebook fans and 5,000 twitter followers.

mccann has lined up sinead o’connor, the singer, to be in the cast, though her role remains to be determined. shane macgowan, the former frontman of the celtic punk band the pogues, has agreed to write the song that will close the film.

but, just as the rebels who staged the rising spent so much of their time lining up the finances that would pay for their act of rebellion, mccann has been necessarily preoccupied with finding financial backers for the $6 million he says he needs to make the film.

he was at the berlin film festival a few weeks ago, looking for investors, and spent most of last year in north america doing the same.

as a producer, mccann’s previous films include 2013’s “volkswagen joe,” a short about a mechanic in a border town reluctantly dragged into the northern ireland conflict; and the 2009 documentary “the boys of st. columb’s,” based on maurice fitzpatrick’s book about the school that produced the first generation of catholic students in northern ireland after the 1947 act of parliament that granted free education. the film’s subjects included the writers seamus heaney and seamus deane and the singer-songwriters paul brady and phil coulter.

his prior experience as a director has been in short films. but he’s undaunted. as heaney once said about peace coming to northern ireland, mccann believes his odyssey to make this film is a time when hope and history will rhyme."

he was named to the court of special sessions in 1948 and occupied that position until 1954, when he was elected united states representative from manhattan's west side on the democratic-liberal ticket.

he vacated his house seat after serving one term and was elected judge of the court of general sessions in 1956. in that post, he presided over the trial in 1958 of seven teen-age gang members for the killing of michael farmer, a 15-year-old polio victim. when he sentenced four of the youths to prison terms ranging from five years to life, judge davidson said that he imposed the penalties with a heavy heart.

wrote an account of trial

''the trial has solved nothing,'' he said at the time, ''but it has proven that we have permitted many of our young people to substitute the streets and association with hoodlums for the home life which has been denied to them.''

the judge wrote an account of the trial, ''the jury is still out,'' which was published in 1959. in 1957, judge davidson deferred sentencing an automobile thief so that an orthopedic surgeon could be found to operate on the young man's malformed hand, which had been burned by his mother. ''i will personally look for a doctor to perform the operation,'' he said. ''the boy is entitled to one break.''

his wife, marion, said yesterday that the judge had anonymously maintained for many years a private fund, collected from his friends, which he used to help particularly needy defendants buy decent clothing for their appearances in court.

in 1962, the court of general sessions was merged into state supreme court. as a justice of that court, he presided over the trial in 1965 of richard robles for the so-called ''career girl'' murders. mr. robles was convicted in that trial of the 1963 slaying of janice wylie and emily hoffert in their east 88th street apartment.

justice davidson retired from the supreme court in 1974, but remained active as a referee for the appellate division, serving without pay.

born in new york city in 1906, justice davidson received a bachelor's degree from the college of arts and science at new york university. nominated for m-g-m school

at the time, the dean nominated him to go to a school sponsored by metro-goldwyn-mayer to study drama. instead, he attended law school at new york university, from which he received a degree in 1928. ''he worked his way through school,'' said mrs. davidson, ''by entertaining on the borscht circuit. he wrote, acted, produced and directed.''

''he chose politics instead of the stage, but he was the most sought-after dinner speaker in new york for many years,'' she continued. ''he was an extraordinary actor and raconteur.'' as a sideline to his early law practice, for example, he wrote scripts for fred allen's radio show.

besides his wife, justice davidson is survived by two sons, james of new york city and mark of washington, d.c., from a previous marriage, and by his stepchildren, dr. joy d. osofsky of topeka, kan., and william r. doniger of greenwich, conn.

a memorial service is to be held this fall at the new york university law school.

later the same day, a second train, carrying only crewmen, derailed at about the same spot, causing no injuries but creating two-hour delays for homebound commuters.

more than 80 passengers were injured in the accident at the st. george terminal, where the staten island rapid transit line connects with the staten island ferry.

eight persons were hospitalized, authorities said, the most seriously injured with a broken leg. an estimated 400 persons were aboard the four-car train and officials said many of them were standing, preparing to disembark, when the accident happened.

the train's motorman, vincent yorks of staten island, was suspended pending the outcome of two federal investigations and one by the staten island rapid transit operating authority, a subsidiary of the metropolitan transportation authority. an official of the national transportation safety board said a preliminary inquiry had turned up no evidence of equipment failure.

transit officials said they were trying to determine whether mr. yorks had applied the train's air brakes and whether they might have failed.

unlike trains in the subway system, the staten island trains do not have automatic brake-tripping devices to compensate for a failure by the motorman. some passengers said the train seemed to be moving faster than normal as it entered the station and other witnesses said the tracks were wet from the fog that had blanketed the area the previous night.

presidents johnson and nixon let that happen and presidents ford and carter issued orders against it. last spring the reagan administration, which had pledged to ''unshackle'' the spy service, raised the possibility of a return to domestic spying with the first draft of a new intelligence order. now the president has signed a revised order that is not reassuring.

the true domestic powers of the c.i.a. are to be spelled out in another, secret set of directives. the secrecy isn't new; the carter administration also kept two sets of books. but as the c.i.a. was the first to complain, some of the secret carter procedures were more restrictive than the published ones. the reagan rules are likely to be too permissive unless congress increases its vigilance in overseeing the procedures.

when congress created the c.i.a. in 1947, it envisioned an agency relatively unfettered by law, operating almost exclusively abroad while the f.b.i. stood guard on the home front. but the line between foreign and domestic activities is often fine. consider, for example, the agency's need to create a cover for a spy by setting him up in some innocent-looking american setting before he is sent abroad on assignment.

this sometimes necessary ability to operate in the united states was subject to abuse. an extreme example was operation chaos, inspired by president johnson's conviction that opponents of the vietnam war, even those who broke no law, had foreign sup-port. he ordered the c.i.a. to prove it, and the agency attempted to do so by compiling thousands of surveillance files that named hundreds of thousands of americans.

the post-watergate reforms required reasonable suspicion of a foreign connection before americans could be catalogued or spied on. that also protected american businessmen from surveillance in their activities abroad. the reagan order unshackles the agency in varying degress, by requiring less suspicion of foreign ties as a condition of domestic surveillance. thus only congressional oversight can make sure that the c.i.a. does not again abuse its powers.

mr. reagan did not, however, turn back the clock to the days when presidents decreed no limits at all. rather than discard the ford-carter orders, he substituted his own. and it specifically recognizes the right of the senate and house intelligence committees to obtain confidential oversight information. the rule of law thus remains embedded in the strange soil of intelligence. more is needed, however, if civil liberties are to be truly protected. the ford and carter orders were, by design, only first steps toward the safeguard of a congressional charter for the c.i.a. the 1978 foreign intelligence surveillance act made another advance by requiring court warrants for wiretaps and bugs.

the reagan administration shows no enthusiasm for a c.i.a. charter. the work of congress, however diligently it polices the executive order, won't be finished until it produces one."
"the rapid introduction of new movies, rock shows and family feature films is creating a boom in video cassette sales and rentals. art morowitz, co-owner of sound-video unlimited, a national distributor, and sole owner of video shack stores, a local chain, said that adult sex film sales today account for ''20 percent or less'' of all cassette sales, both in his stores and nationally as well. i'll stand by that,'' said bruce apar, the magazine's editor and co-publisher. '' people in this business don't brag about their x-rated cassette sales,'' he said. '' little professor books, for example, in great neck, l.i., carries feature film titles but nothing x-rated. i could see that people expected a certain standard. still a lot of demand'

robert j. friedman, co-owner of the san francisco-based captain video chain, also put adult film sales in the 20 percent range. '' two years ago, when we started out, it was 30 percent of the business,'' he said. '' certainly, part of the problem in estimating a market share for adult videotapes may simply be a question of definition. according to retailers, distributors and analysts, x-rated films are becoming more sophisticated, and budgets are getting bigger as the market continues to expand. goldste in agreed, but took that point a step further. ''","the rapid introduction of new movies, rock shows and family feature films is creating a boom in video cassette sales and rentals. but within this market, dealers say, the adult x-rated tapes remain a major factor.

these tapes, which were the early mainstay of the market, may be losing some market share, but they are increasing their dollar volume. in addition, they are solidifying their hold in the cities and beginning to move into the suburbs, although many image-conscious retailers tend to play down their popularity.

estimates of video pornography's market share range from 20 percent to 50 percent. as recently as 1978, such features accounted for up to 70 percent of rentals and sales in the video cassette business, which is expected to total about $1 billion this year, up from $600 million in 1981.

art morowitz, co-owner of sound-video unlimited, a national distributor, and sole owner of video shack stores, a local chain, said that adult sex film sales today account for ''20 percent or less'' of all cassette sales, both in his stores and nationally as well.

at video shack, which was one of the first metropolitan area retailers, opening in 1978, mr. morowitz said that his inventory of adult features accounts for ''an important part of the business, but it's not the reason we're in business.''

while some analysts agreed with mr. morowitz's estimate, others said it was far too low. video magazine, for example, in a story in the february issue, estimates that adult video cassettes account for about 40 percent of the market. ''i'll stand by that,'' said bruce apar, the magazine's editor and co-publisher. ''twenty percent would definitely se em to me to be an underestimate.'' people 'don't brag'

allan raphael, an analyst with arnhold & s. bleichroeder, said sex tapes account for at least 30 percent, and possibly as much as 50 percent, of the videotape market. ''people in this business don't brag about their x-rated cassette sales,'' he said. ''it's not in their interest to portray themselves as pornographers.''

according to mr. raphael the average video cassette retailer no longer operates in the seedy peep show districts like those around 42d street in new york. rather, he said, as the number of other titles available has expanded, and as family feature films became available, they have moved to the suburbs.

''they bill themselves as 'home entertainment centers,' '' he said, ''even though the whole back wall might be lined with the adult titles.''

indeed, the exodus of videotape retailers from red-light district to suburban shopping center has paralleled the increase in the variety of tapes that such retailers have to sell. moreover, many of the suburban stores that sell and rent videotapes do not specialize in them. 'certain standard' sought

and not all of these stores stock x-rated films. little professor books, for example, in great neck, l.i., carries feature film titles but nothing x-rated. sal cimilluca, the shop's owner, said he considered carrying them, ''but this is a conservative community. i could see that people expected a certain standard. i couldn't risk offending them.''

richard baldi, owner of consumer video, in commack, l.i., said that adult tapes accounted for 35 to 40 percent of the sales in his tape shop, which started as a sideline in his vacuum cleaner store last year.

another tape retailer, in somerville, n.j., who asked not to be identified, said he kept x-rated adult titles in the back room of his appliance store. ''you have to specifically ask for them,'' he said. ''i can't risk an open display.''

mr. morowitz agreed that some retailers may play down the importance of the adult cassette sales, but maintained the accuracy of his figures. ''it doesn't do well to play up the adult business we're doing because it's not what the business is all about,'' he said.

indeed, at video stop inc., in new york, jeff padnick, a co-owner, said that sales and rentals of adult films accounted for only about a quarter of his business. ''the public has been misled to believe that home video is 'home porn,' '' he said. ''that's just not true.'' 'still a lot of demand'

robert j. friedman, co-owner of the san francisco-based captain video chain, also put adult film sales in the 20 percent range. ''two years ago, when we started out, it was 30 percent of the business,'' he said. ''but there's still a lot of demand.''

certainly, part of the problem in estimating a market share for adult videotapes may simply be a question of definition. for example, if sales rather than rentals are stressed, sources in the business say, then the figures may be misleading.

according to mr. apar of video magazine, the trend in the retail cassette business is toward rentals rather than sales. analysts said the ratio of rentals to sales is 12 to 1. adult tapes, mr. apar added, are leading that trend.

''you have to look at total revenue,'' mr. apar said. ''a segment could lose sales in a current year and still maintain its market share.''

another problem of definition concerns the classification of the tapes. according to retailers, distributors and analysts, x-rated films are becoming more sophisticated, and budgets are getting bigger as the market continues to expand.

al goldstein, publisher of screw magazine, said that retailers may be underestimating their sales by focusing only on ''hard-core'' films. in the past, mr. goldstein said, x-rated films were seen and judged almost exclusively by men.

''the product is changing today because more couples are seeing it,'' he said. ''now they're actually trying to introduce plots and characters with real problems - real films with sex.''

according to mr. morowitz of video shack, which said that ' 'bad girls'' was the most popular x-rated film in december, just about allthe current growth in the adult segment of vi deotapes can be attributed to the number of home video record ers being sold. ''most adult buying is done by people who've just bo ught a machine and want to have a tape or two around,'' mr. morowitz said. mr. goldste in agreed, but took that point a step further. ''people want to look at the forbidden,'' he said. ''they're not buying these machines to l ook at 'superman.' what's the point of that?''

"two questions left over from a recent chat got me thinking again about people’s fixation with the home mortgage deduction. the money in the savings account earns far less than the interest rate on the mortgage. people are telling me that paying off the mortgage will negatively affect my taxes, since i will no longer have that deduction. by the way, i’m single with no kids and in my 50s. because of the mortgage interest deduction, many people are enticed into buying a home before they are ready. you don’t want to be house-rich and cash-poor, meaning all your money is locked into the equity in your home — equity, i might add, that you can tap only by borrowing against your home or by selling it. i still think it’s a good investment and probably cheaper than continuing to rent for years down the road. your mother should factor in when she wants to retire and whether her retirement income can handle a mortgage.","two questions left over from a recent chat got me thinking again about people’s fixation with the home mortgage deduction.

understandably, around tax time people wonder if they are getting all of the deductions and credits they are entitled to take. one of the most coveted tax breaks is for mortgage interest.

so revered is this deduction that some folks who have the money to pay off their mortgages struggle to decide whether it even makes sense to be debt-free. here’s some examples:

q: i have enough money in savings to pay off my mortgage in full and still have a cushion for emergencies. the money in the savings account earns far less than the interest rate on the mortgage.

people are telling me that paying off the mortgage will negatively affect my taxes, since i will no longer have that deduction. but it seems to me that i only get a benefit of a portion of the money i pay out for the interest.

i can live within my means without the mortgage payment and i do not live large (no cable, no cellphone, etc.) but i can’t with it. it is important to me to max out my retirement savings/401(k), and that takes up a chunk of my paycheck. by the way, i’m single with no kids and in my 50s. what do you think?

a: i know i’ll get letters from people who will disagree with me, but i say go for being debt-free — with a caveat.

if you itemize deductions on your tax return, you can usually deduct the interest you pay on a mortgage for your main home. the home mortgage deduction is different from a tax credit, a distinction that is sometimes lost on people trumpeting the tax break as a key reason to get a home or keep a mortgage. a tax credit reduces dollar-for-dollar the taxes you owe. a deduction eliminates only a percentage of the tax.

if you don’t have a mortgage, you may pay more in taxes, but not as much as you would have to pay in annual interest on the home loan, especially in the beginning years. you are right on the money to appreciate how illogical it is to keep a mortgage just for the tax break.

because of the mortgage interest deduction, many people are enticed into buying a home before they are ready. yes, the deduction is a nice bonus. but it shouldn’t be the primary reason to get a home or to hold on to the loan if you can afford to pay it off early.

by the way, many people don’t even take the deduction. “close to half of homeowners with mortgages — most of them middle- and lower-income families — receive no benefit from the deduction,” writes the center on budget and policy priorities.

here’s my caveat about paying off your mortgage: be careful about getting rid of your savings in the current economy. really think about whether you are vulnerable to losing your job, because if it takes you a long time to find employment, or you can’t work because of health reasons, you could easily use up your emergency fund.

i don’t suggest that you clean out your savings or sell all of your investments to pay off your mortgage. you don’t want to be house-rich and cash-poor, meaning all your money is locked into the equity in your home — equity, i might add, that you can tap only by borrowing against your home or by selling it.

but since you have a good emergency fund and retirement savings, and you can still pay off your mortgage with money from outside of those two pots, i’d do it.

i often ask people this: if you had a paid-off home, would you take out a loan just so you could deduct the interest?

i hope you would say, “absolutely not, that’s crazy.”

q: my mother is turning 57 and is thinking about buying a house. she’s been renting for more than eight years, and from what i can tell the costs really add up. i think that it’s a good and financially savvy move tax-wise. i still think it’s a good investment and probably cheaper than continuing to rent for years down the road. what do you think?

a: the tax advantage of buying a home shouldn’t be front and center when considering if it’s prudent to buy a home, whether you’re 27 or 57.

your mother should factor in when she wants to retire and whether her retirement income can handle a mortgage.

she might qualify for a mortgage with her current income, but she’s nearing the typical retirement years. she needs to ask herself a lot of other questions and make sure she can afford a mortgage, based not just on the monthly payment. there are a lot of other costs and issues associated with homeownership."

a chinese city has banned schools from holding christmas events, highlighting official suspicions about the increasingly popular festival because of its foreign origins.

china's christian population, currently estimated at around 60 million, is rapidly growing and christmas is increasingly marked in the country ruled by the officially atheist communist party.

but the government education bureau in wenzhou, an eastern chinese coastal city sometimes called ""china's jerusalem"" because of its large christian population, banned schools from holding ""christmas-related"" events, the global times reported.

local officials ""hope schools can pay more attention to chinese traditional festivals instead of western traditions"", said the tabloid, which has close ties to the communist party.

interest in christmas has grown in china as an occasion for shopping, with marketeers using everything from saxophones and smurfs to steam trains to get consumers to open their wallets.

but authorities in wenzhou this year launched a demolition campaign aimed at local churches, with more than 400 forced to remove visible crosses and some completely destroyed.

the ban came as a university in central china required students to watch a documentary about chinese sage confucius instead of celebrating christmas.

london, aug 19 (reuters) - oil prices steadied on wednesday ahead of u.s. oil data expected to show falling crude and gasoline stockpiles, raising hopes of increased demand for crude.

prices consolidated after a six-week rout driven by global oversupply and concerns about falling demand in asian economies and the united states.

u.s. government data on crude stockpiles is due at 10:30 a.m. est (1430 gmt) on wednesday. a reuters poll estimated on average that commercial u.s. crude stocks fell by just under 800,000 barrels in the week to aug. 14.

the american petroleum institute reported on tuesday that u.s. crude stocks had fallen by an even greater margin - by 2.3 million barrels in the week ended aug. 14.

u.s. crude oil futures, also known as west texas intermediate (wti), were down 25 cents at $42.37 a barrel by 1140 gmt. the front-month, september, u.s. crude oil contract is due to expire on thursday. north sea brent crude was up 5 cents at $48.86 a barrel.

u.s. oil production is at record levels and producer costs appear to be declining, with no output scale-back anticipated.

bearish sentiment was exacerbated last week when repairs at a large refinery in whiting, indiana caused a large stock build at cushing, oklahoma, the delivery point for u.s. crude futures. 1/8id: nl1n10o1b9 3/8

oil has lost about a third of its value since june and prices have been hovering just above six-year lows for the past week. the downward trend has been driven by global oversupply and record stockpile levels, analysts say.

""the recent drop in the price of oil confirms ... the global commitment producers have to their current levels of (high) output,"" said scott cockerham, managing director houston-based conway mackenzie's energy advisory services.

many analysts said they expect some temporary price stabilisation as people take profits from short positions. but they said the downward price trend was likely to continue unless there was a significant reduction in global supply.

""i think the market has pushed too low and too fast,"" abn amro energy economist hans van cleef said. he added that, although he could see oil prices rebounding in the coming weeks, he thought they would remain low into next year.

anz bank said: ""any recovery in wti prices from a six-year low may be short-lived with the u.s. entering the slow demand period in september.""

a video of the dogs frolicking in the sunshine together at the sasa pejčić’s shelter in nis, serbia, was posted to youtube and already has more than 12,300 views.

the dogs are housed by a charity called the harmony fund.

“rather than being warehoused in cages and kennels, the dogs here play all day long. they experience joy, good food and human kindness - often for the very first time.”

many of the dogs reportedly arrive at the sanctuary malnourished or with broken bones and are nursed back to full health by their new carers.

the fund relies on donations to feed the dogs and maintain the sanctuary.

“the cost of care for each dog here is $15 a month, yet we only have sponsors for 88 dogs,” it wrote.

the sanctuary said it is stock-piling food for winter because it refuses to reduce the food intake of each dog despite a lack of funds.

"poisoning case@ (changes headline, first paragraph to show monsanto liable, not ""guilty"", in the civil court ruling)

lyon/paris, france, sept 10 (reuters) - a french court upheld on thursday a 2012 ruling in which monsanto was found to be liable in the chemical poisoning of a french farmer, who says he suffered neurological problems after inhaling the u.s. ""we are speaking about modest sums of money or even nonexistent. lasso is not monsanto's sole herbicide accused of being harmful.","poisoning case@ (changes headline, first paragraph to show monsanto liable, not ""guilty"", in the civil court ruling)

lyon/paris, france, sept 10 (reuters) - a french court upheld on thursday a 2012 ruling in which monsanto was found to be liable in the chemical poisoning of a french farmer, who says he suffered neurological problems after inhaling the u.s. company's lasso weedkiller.

the decision by an appeal court in lyon, southeast france, confirmed the initial judgment, the first such case heard in court in france, that ruled monsanto was ""responsible"" for the intoxication and ordered the company to ""fully compensate"" grain grower paul francois.

monsanto's lawyer said the u.s. biotech company would now take the case to france's highest appeal court.

francois, who says he suffered memory loss, headaches and stammering after inhaling monsanto's lasso in 2004, blames the agri-business giant for not providing adequate warnings on the product label.

lasso, a pre-emergent soil-applied herbicide that has been used since the 1960s to control grasses and broadleaf weeds in farm fields, was banned in france in 2007 after the product had already been withdrawn in other countries such as canada, belgium and britain.

monsanto phased out of lasso in the united states several years ago for commercial reasons, its spokesman in france said.

though it once was a top-selling herbicide, it gradually lost popularity, and critics say several studies have shown links to a range of health problems.

monsanto said in a statement after the ruling that experts, including those nominated by the french civil court, had not found any causal link between the alleged accidental exposure and the alleged damages for which francois claims compensation.

the company's lawyer, jean-daniel bretzner, said a potential fine to compensate for the farmer's loss would be decided after the decision of the highest court but he said that in any case it would be very low.

""we are speaking about modest sums of money or even nonexistent. he already received indemnities (by insurers) and there is a fundamental rule that says that one does not compensate twice for a loss, if any,"" jean-daniel bretzner said.

lasso is not monsanto's sole herbicide accused of being harmful.

the international agency for research on cancer (iarc), part of the world health organization (who), said in march that glyphosate, the key ingredient in monsanto's roundup, one of the world's most used herbicides, was ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

monsanto reacted to the finding in june by demanding a retraction, labeling the findings by a team of international cancer scientists as ""junk science.""

itt’s parent company, itt educational services inc., announced in financial disclosures wednesday that the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools had asked the company to “show cause at the next acics meeting why its current grants of accreditation should not be withdrawn by suspension or otherwise conditioned.”

maintaining this accreditation is a requirement for itt to receive federal student loan funding. these funds compose 80% of itt’s revenue, and the company has said that without access to federal funding it wouldn’t be able to continue operations. a delay in access to federal funds in 2014 was the first domino to fall for corinthian colleges inc., another for-profit college chain that ultimately collapsed and liquidated its assets.

itt called the action by the council “unexpected and unfortunate” but added that it will comply and is confident that it can address any of the council’s concerns.

“we are disappointed that our accrediting body is asking for a public rehashing of allegations widely known to be heavily promoted by activists, unions and select politicians working in concert to undermine educational options for non-traditional students,” itt spokeswoman nicole elam said in a statement thursday.

itt says that the accrediting council’s request for information has questioned “the institutions’ administrative capacity, organizational integrity, financial viability and ability to serve students in a manner that complies with acics standards,” but added that it “strongly believes that the facts it provides in response to acics’s request will continue to demonstrate the company’s and institutions’ compliance with regulatory and accreditation criteria.”

“the council has been monitoring itt’s performance data intensely prior to issuing the directive and this is a natural next step within their oversight authority,” the accreditation council said in a statement.

recently, the counsel has begun updating and improving its standards for accreditation and plans to complete a new criteria by july 1.

the demand comes as itt faces lawsuits and investigations from state attorneys general, the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau and the u.s. securities and exchange commission. it has also been placed on a more strict financial status, called heightened cash monitoring, by the u.s. department of education.

the actions from regulators largely stem from an old student loan program implemented by itt during the 2009 financial downturn. the cfpb has claimed that itt prodded students into high-cost student lending programs held off the company’s balance sheet and the sec says that itt didn’t disclose the poor performance of the loans to investors. itt has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

criticisms and allegations surrounding high debt obligations and low job placement rates for their students have plagued the for-profit college industry for several years. amid the fallout from the corinthian colleges collapse, the u.s. department of education has begun forgiving the loans of students claiming they were unfairly lured into debt.

in 2012 and 2013, more than 18% of itt students had default on their loans within three years of entering repayment and hundreds of former itt students have applied for forgiveness under the federal program.

based in carmel, ind., itt was started in 1969 and now has 130 campuses in 38 states. the schools offer degrees in information technology, criminal justice and nursing.

when military and defense-industry officials gather at the air force association’s air and space conference in suburban washington, a major topic of discussion on the sidelines is likely to be aerojet rocketdyne’s $2 billion offer for united launch alliance llc, a 50-50 rocket venture between lockheed martin corp. and boeing co.

aerojet rocketdyne officials hope to discuss the bid with the joint venture’s parents, as well as air force brass, according to people familiar with the matter.

“we might see some movement” after those efforts, one person said, “either positive or negative.”

as of saturday, the joint venture hadn’t allowed aerojet rocketdyne representatives to conduct due diligence on its books, according to this person.

the offer has been pending for weeks. aerojet rocketdyne initially had hoped to wrap up negotiations in time to make a big splash with an announcement during the aerospace conference. but disputes over valuation and questions about possible responses by the pentagon have complicated the process, according to people familiar with the details.

in addition, boeing has balked at selling, according to several people, partly because united launch’s leadership has held out the possibility of granting boeing lucrative contracts to produce components for the atlas v rocket.

the parts could be manufactured at a government-owned facility in new orleans where boeing already builds parts for a different rocket being developed for the national aeronautics and space administration, according to one person.

if successful, aerojet rocketdyne’s bid would shake up a global rocket industry already reeling from the emergence of low-cost launches offered by entrepreneur elon musk ’s space exploration technologies corp; aggressive marketing efforts by europe’s arianespace sa to sell bargain launches on russian-built soyuz rockets; and increasing indications that the u.s. air force eventually wants to purchase most of its satellite launches as a straight commercial service, rather than invest taxpayer dollars to develop a new generation of rockets.

all told, united launch is expected to have to invest more than $2 billion through the beginning of the next decade to replace its current fleet of atlas v and delta iv launchers with a family of lower-cost rockets containing all domestic content. the venture, however, confronts congressional pressure to phase out use of russian-built main engines on the atlas v before then.

meanwhile, united launch faces eroding profits and reduced financial support from its parents, who have been unwilling to make long-term commitments to fund the new rocket, dubbed vulcan.

tory bruno, united launch’s chief executive, abruptly changed the complexion of the venture’s rocket development strategy last week by announcing an agreement with a startup company run by amazon.com inc. chairman jeff bezos, to ramp up production of the be-4 engine. choosing between the be-4, offered by mr. bezos, and a rival engine being developed by aerojet rocketdyne had been slated to occur in late 2016.

mr. bruno has been unwilling to comment on aerojet rocketdyne’s interest in united launch, except to say on twitter that he expects to “see a very bright future for ula and for the future of space.”

calderon was at the bulls’ 3-point line.

transition defense — actually, any defense — was not on the bulls’ menu thursday at the garden. but defense, aggressive plays, fun plays, were definitely on the knicks’ side — along with carmelo anthony and kristaps porzingis.

anthony scored 26 points, added seven rebounds and four assists while porzingis, in a 19-point and 10-rebound effort, notched his 20th double-double of the season and second in two nights as the knicks topped the bulls, 106-94, at the garden. the victory gave the knicks a home-and-home sweep and consecutive wins for the first time in over two months.

“i thought the level of energy we played with, the way we got off to fast starts and then multiple guys contributed out there,” said anthony when asked to explain how the knicks, bordering on official playoff extinction, could come up with successive victories over a team trying for the playoffs.

and those victories left the bulls, who were without pau gasol (knee), searching.

“i have never been so frustrated before. it was disappointing,” said chicago’s taj gibson, who scored 10 points in support of a game-high 30 from derrick rose and 19 from jimmy butler.

but while the bulls (36-35) were frustrated and disappointed, the knicks (30-43) were ecstatic, near giddy. you know, 68-foot alley-oop pass plays can do that. and defense that stopped the bulls in their 41.6 percent shooting tracks can do that, too.

“we realized what the game plan was. we really focused on defense,” said the 7-foot-3 rookie porzingis, who shot 7-of-15 from the floor, one night after registering his personal high of 29 points. “we knew that was going to win us the game, and i think we did a better job in the second half. and offensively, the game was going our way.”

a good example was right before halftime. after calderon nailed a left-corner 3-pointer at 4:43 of the second quarter, the knicks led 45-36. but chicago rallied, pulling within 47-45, when gibson scored at 2:35. so then came the ball movement that interim coach kurt rambis extolled.

“their ability to get to spots on the floor, get organized, allows them to be efficient offensively,” rambis said.

enter offensive efficiency — from williams, who scored 13 points off the bench, from arron afflalo, who scored 11 in his fifth turn in six games as a reserve after 56 starts, from sasha vujacic, who scored all nine of his points on a triple of 3s in the first quarter and of course from anthony and porzingis.

twice taking feeds from anthony, porzingis banged home two 3s 30 seconds apart, and the knicks waltzed into halftime leading 53-45.

“it was just a matter of taking advantage of what they were doing. we knew they were coming on the dribble in the post, to double-team,” anthony said. “somebody was open. a lot of times it was kp. so it was a matter of me making the right decision.

“a lot of times, in his position, he’s trailing and his man is in the paint,” anthony said. “so it’s a matter of him actually making the shot.”

said porzingis, who had been slumping (shooting .333 over nine games before wednesday), “i’ve been working a lot on my shot.”

now, as effective as those shots were, the two that got the biggest rise from the crowd were those calderon-to-williams feeds.

“it was nice. we have a good connection out there every time we play together. so it was the right play to make,” calderon said, agreeing the first heave was “your basic 68-foot” alley-oop.

“he’s an amazing passer,” williams said. “we don’t get to practice that much. the practice is in the game.”"

michael cerussi iii was accused of rape while a student at union college in schenectady, n.y., but to be clear, the alleged victim never filed a police report and no charges were ever filed outside of the victim’s complaint to the school.

cerussi filed a lawsuit in 2001 against union college and the alleged victim, following his expulsion from the school in 2000 after a female student he partied with accused him and a fellow fraternity brother of having sex with her against her will. the case dragged out for two years, before a settlement was reached and the case was voluntarily dismissed.

according to one of cerussi’s former lawyers, the school agreed to reverse the expulsion and reinstate him as part of the settlement, though cerussi never returned to uc. confidenti@l is withholding the name of the alleged victim out of respect for her privacy.

in spite of low ratings, bethenny frankel's 'bethenny' set to return

according to court papers, the alleged victim accused cerussi and another fraternity brother of raping her at a fraternity house. while cerussi admitted to engaging in consensual sexual relations with her, he denied that he raped her. another court document summarizes cerussi’s version of what happened as he alleged in his lawsuit:

“plaintiff (cerussi) and (another fraternity brother) met (victim) at a bar near uc late friday night, november 11, 2000. (victim) accompanied them back to their fraternity house and had sexual intercourse with both men. plaintiff and (victim) talked afterwards, he drove her home, and she kissed him good-night. (victim) then joked with her roommate about having sex with both men, and did not state that she had been raped.

“at brunch the next morning, (victim) told a girlfriend that she had sex with two men, but did not claim that she had been raped. but shortly thereafter, when some of plaintiff’s fraternity brothers laughed as they passed her table, (victim) assumed they had been told that she had sex with plaintiff and (a fraternity brother). that evening, (victim) received a phone call from another of plaintiff’s fraternity brothers, and inferred from the conversation that (he) knew she had sex with plaintiff and (another fraternity brother). sometime later, (victim) concluded that she had been raped, went to ellis hospital and reported the same. on the following day, november 13, 2000, (victim) reported to (the then associate dean of students) that she had been raped.”

cerussi, 34, who works in finance, is nine years younger than frankel. he lived at home with his parents in riverside, conn., while the hearings went on.

after pictures of frankel and cerussi emerged after new year’s eve, frankel got her hired guns on the case, with her publicist making the rounds of calls on cerussi’s behalf, a source tells us. the duo knew press were sniffing around about the lawsuit, in which cerussi insisted the girl’s claims were false and that the school had no right to expel him.

there are about 30 soloists and dance companies, most of them based in tokyo, that share the butoh esthetic. to take audiences on a backward journey to primordial states of being, for example, the five-man troupe known as sankai juku (resembling anonymous, alien beings, with their heads shaved and their bodies painted a uniform white) used to be lowered by ropes from high above the stage, their fetus-like bodies gradually unfolding.

in an even darker vein, in min tanaka's ''homage to kandinsky'' two men and two women shuffle across a darkened stage, clutching one another's sleeves, their mouths open, their red-rimmed eyes rolling. min tanaka emerges, and he is set upon by the two women, now clad only in oversized men's shoes.

if the butoh message is sometimes bewil-dering, the visual impact is raw and direct - as the photographer ethan hoffman discovered when he attended his first butoh performance in 1984. hoffman, who divides his time between tokyo and new york, went on to photograph many of the major figures in butoh, and early this year he assembled his images to form not a documentary but a kind of photographic theater.

this work, titled ''butoh: dance of the dark soul,'' will be seen at new york's burden gallery, beginning thursday and ending dec. 5. min tanaka, three of whose dance pieces are in the exhibition, will perform at the opening. a book of the photographs will be published by aperture next month. neither the exhibition nor the book will contain explanatory captions, only the titles of the dance pieces. ''i would like people to look at the exhibition and the book as one performance,'' says hoffman.

when ethan hoffman first went with a friend to a cramped underground tokyo club called plan b for a performance of min tanaka's ''homage to kandinsky,'' he became very nervous.

''it was frightening and exhilarating at the same time,'' he recalls. ''you sat on the floor. you couldn't move because there were people almost on top of you. the dancers were 10 feet away and there were only two spotlights. i didn't react on an intellectual level. most things i react to intellectually, but i just felt emotionally overwhelmed by what i saw. i felt as though i'd taken some hallucinogenic drug.''

shortly thereafter, hoffman began a three-year journey of discovery into this distinctly japanese dance theater, one that bears little resemblance to such traditional theatrical forms as noh or kabuki. he telephoned the grand old man of butoh, kazuo ohno, to set up a photographic session. the dancer, then 78 years old, invited the photographer to his studio. ''he danced for four hours,'' remembers hoffman. ''then he cooked dinner for me.''

in the late 1950's, ohno and a young avant-garde dancer from the rural north, tatsumi hijikata, had pioneered a dance theater that became known as butoh. (hijikata called his performance style ankoku butoh, or ''dance of darkness and gloom.'' two japanese characters make up the word ''butoh'': ''bu'' for dance, ''toh'' for step.) hijikata briefly collaborated with ohno, whose work reflects the influences of german expressionism and christianity. but the younger dancer developed a radically different style during the late 1960's and the first half of the 70's. hijikata, who died of cancer early last year at the age of 57, in many ways eclipsed ohno in the effect his highly provocative medium of protest has had on dancers. a lean and agile man who wore his long hair loosely rolled up in a bun, hijikata was influenced early in his career by dadaism and surrealism and inspired by the dictum of antonin artaud, the french experimental-theater director, to make theater that was crude. after this initial phase, however, the rural culture of his youth became the dominant influence.

hijikata and ohno shared the unmistakable butoh characteristic: subversiveness. both had seen their country devastated by war. in a culture distinguished for its visual harmony, the two dancers highlighted ugliness, replacing the conventional japanese social mask of reticence and understatement with one of anguish and even terror. ohno, who is now 81, in one of his signature performances is dressed in a thrift-shop gown and hat, his face painted white, his teeth blackened, mascara smeared around his eyes. every movement of his face and body exquisitely improvised, he looks like a woman caught between memory and madness.

hijikata's butoh has been taken up by a second generation of dancers, who include uno man. ethan hoffman opens his photographic performance with a dance work by uno titled ''21,000 leagues'' (shown on page 40). to hoffman, the work symbolizes birth - a recurring butoh theme."

theirs is a tale of secret arms caches and exotic code names, of military stratagems and political intrigues.

at best, their tale is no more than a curious footnote to the cold war. the question is if, at worst, it could be the key to unsolved terrorism dating back two decades. nowhere do the darker suspicions burn more intensely than in this capital whose appetite for conspiracy theories is insatiable and whose parliament today began an investigation into where reality may lie.

the focus of the inquiry is a clandestine operation code-named gladio, created decades ago to arm and train resistance fighters in case the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies invaded. all this week, there have been disclosures of similar organizations in virtually all western european countries, including those that do not belong to the north atlantic treaty organization. an italian creation

as disclosed in recent days by the italian prime minister, giulio andreotti, gladio, named after after the short, wide, double-edged sword used by gladiators in ancient rome, came into being during the most gelid days of the cold war.

it was originally an italian creation, said mr. andreotti, who is scheduled to testify on friday before a parliamentary commission studying bombings and massacres that claimed scores of lives in a terrorism wave that inundated italy from 1969 to the early 1980's.

the prime minister said last week that gladio later evolved into a branch of an extensive network, operated within nato and abetted by a 1956 agreement between the united states and italian secret services. over the years, he says, 622 italians belonged to the operation -- civilians who were trained by intelligence operatives and who had fought in world war ii or served in the peacetime forces. preparing the guerrillas

germany, france, belgium, the netherlands, greece and luxembourg have all acknowledged that they maintained gladio-style networks to prepare guerrilla fighters to leap into action in the event of a warsaw pact invasion. many worked under the code name stay behind. greece called its operation red sheepskin.

news reports in recent days assert that similar programs have also existed in britain, norway, portugal, spain, austria, turkey and denmark, and even in neutral countries like switzerland and sweden. the british newspaper the guardian today quoted a former commander in chief of nato forces in northern europe as saying that the purpose was to have a secret organization in place for guerrilla warfare if britain were overrun by communist troops.

""the original plan was to establish a network to arm guerrillas from the civil populace while conventional forces were occupied elsewhere,"" said the former commander, sir anthony farrar-hockley.

diplomats in rome and other european capitals say the network was inspired by anti-nazi resistance movements in world war ii, but that it was hoped these new clandestine units would be better organized. ""you have to remember,"" a highly placed western european official said, ""that at the time everyone was praising the french resistance, the italian resistance, and everyone had to be prepared."" secret arms deposits

these would-be fighters had stockpiles of weapons and explosives, officials say. henk vredeling, the netherlands' defense minister in the 1970's, said he had known of weapons caches that were to be used for behind-the-lines sabotage. the german newspaper die welt reported that among secret stores of weapons in what used to be west germany were grenade launchers, pistols and explosives.

in rome, mr. andreotti disclosed that secret arms deposits were dismantled as far back as 1972 but that the secret services could not find 12 of them. their disappearance has fueled speculation here that the weapons ended up in terrorist hands. contributing to this conjecture are press reports that some of the underground ""gladiators,"" as they have been dubbed, had close links to neo-fascist groups and to intelligence organizations.

but the chief of italian military intelligence, adm. fulvio martini, insisted today that operation gladio had no ties to right-wing groups and that its only purpose was to resist invasion.

""not one of the 622 was ever involved in any conspiracies or plots,"" admiral martini said in testimony before the parliamentary commission. varied from country to country

it appears that gladio operations varied from country to country. many worked within a nato framework, but some -- the netherlands, for example -- say their resistance fighters were organized purely as a national force.

in some countries, the networks were shut down years ago. greece's socialists say that they discovered theirs when they took power in 1981, finally abolishing it and rounding up weapons in 1985. in france, president francois mitterrand said this week that it was he who eliminated the french branch, but he did not say when.

even in countries like italy where gladio remains in force, its members seem to have little fighting spirit left. 'gladiators' still recruited

new ""gladiators"" are still recruited, and two members of parliament say they visited a military base on the island of sardinia where guerrilla training exercises were held last spring. but admiral martini told the investigating commission that nearly three-fourths of the 622 members were over the age of 50, or were dead.

nevertheless, the network continues, and several officials reported that a supervisory committee of european secret services met in brussels only a month ago.

nourishing conspiracy theories are assertions from key european leaders that they knew nothing about the operation until recently. joseph luns, who was nato secretary general from 1971 to 1984, said he had never heard of it. belgium's defense minister, guy coeme, told a radio station today that ""things were hidden from me""

admiral martini told the lawmakers that some italian prime ministers were also kept in the dark. indeed, as the gladio story began to unfold, italy's only two postwar prime ministers not to come from the conservative christian democratic party -- bettino craxi, a socialist, and giovanni spadolini, a republican -- insisted that the disclosures came as news to them. agreement with u.s. agencies

there were other disturbing developments for italian politicians and journalists, who as a group demonstrate a cultivated taste for intrigue and a slender faith in coincidence.

there was mr. andreotti's mention of the 1956 agreement with united states agencies, whose aim for decades was to make sure that the italian communist party, the largest in the west, never got a foothold in the government. and there were long-reported links between italian secret services and neo-fascists.

and there is the fact that the major unsolved acts of terrorism that rocked italy in the 1970's are all presumed to be the work of people on the far right. left-wing terrorists like the moribund red brigades somehow were caught and imprisoned.

swept up in the dispute is president francesco cossiga, who declared recently that it had been his ""privilege"" to help organize gladio when he was in the defense ministry in the 1960's. some independent left members of parliament have since demanded his impeachment, but mr. cossiga remains unflappable.

fact is, he said, ""i admire the fact that we have kept the secret for 45 years.""

schaumburg-based sagent pharmaceuticals has agreed to be acquired by nichi-iko pharmaceutical of tokyo for about $736 million.

the deal unites two companies in the generic drug business, a huge global market that has high volumes but low profit margins. foreign companies are on a shopping binge to win a bigger share of the u.s. market for generic drugs, which is the largest in the world. generic drugs account for about 80 percent of prescriptions dispensed in the u.s.

""we are looking forward to working with sagent's talented management team and learning from what is clearly a highly skilled and productive workforce.""

the u.s. generics market, which had $43.5 billion in sales in 2013, is forecast to grow at an average of 11 percent annually, according to consulting firm rncos. an aging population, demand for cheaper medications and expiring patents on blockbuster drugs are some of the factors driving growth.

sagent, founded in 2006, is at least the third chicago-area drugmaker to be swallowed up in the past year. last month, irish drugmaker shire completed a $32 billion takeover of baxalta, based in bannockburn. in september, pfizer purchased lake forest-based hospira for $15 billion.

sagent focuses on injectable drugs that are sold to hospitals. its portfolio includes blood thinners and medicines to treat infections and cancer.

sales grew steadily from 2011, when it went public, to 2015, but the company's stock price fell by more than 60 percent between october 2014 and may 2016. in march 2015, founder jeffrey yordon abruptly resigned as chairman and ceo. nine months later sagent started exploring a sale of the business, according to published reports.

sagent stockholders will receive $21.75 per share, a 40 percent premium to the company's friday closing price of $15.50. vivo capital, a california venture capital firm that is sagent's largest stockholder, has agreed to tender its shares, according to the news release.

""after thoroughly evaluating our strategic options, our board of directors has unanimously decided that this all-cash transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders,"" sagent ceo allan oberman said in the news release. ""we are confident that nichi-iko is the ideal partner to help us push forward into our next stage of growth and solidify our position as a leading provider of affordable pharmaceuticals to the hospital and clinic market.""

sagent will become a subsidiary of nichi-iko when the deal closes, which is expected to happen by september. no changes to sagent's current operations are currently anticipated, according to the news release, and nichi-iko expects that sagent's current management team will continue to lead the business from its schaumburg headquarters.

at the end of 2015, sagent had 440 full-time employees, of which 114 were in the u.s."

i've been thrilled by the reception the novel has had, but it's certainly a new kind of experience. i'm used to operating on the margins. translators, unless they're translating religious texts and get killed for heresy, tend to disappear from the public record. and most poets, unless they have a tragic death or kill themselves, tend to disappear from the record too — especially women. but there's also a freedom that comes from knowing nobody is paying attention to you. it's easier to dismiss the rules, to dismiss the idea of genre and any other conventions that don't fit with the kind of work you are most moved to create.

much of my life takes place in that vapor between languages. i speak spanish at home with my family and write in english and translate from portuguese. constantly moving between languages keeps a person mentally adventurous. i think it made me a more adventurous writer and not just at the sentence level but also in the sort of high-stakes story i ended up creating in the novel.

translators are regularly marginalized in the literary world. do you see your book, in which the protagonist is a translator, as a kind of rectification or inversion of this situation?

i set out to invert many things in this novel, but yes, the way we depict translators was certainly one of them. i wrote the novel i couldn't find. i'd come across several works of fiction about translators but the portrayals didn't quite ring true. the risk-taking, the reckless joys of translation, the generous spirit that drives many people to become translators, something was always missing. once i came up with the online poker part, i thought why not? why not write the novel i was longing to read?

while this novel celebrates language, it also seems to assert the unreliability of words, their ambiguities, their inadequacies. is your relationship to language contentious?

i would say my relationship to language is more rapturous than contentious. i live for the rapture of focusing so intently on the words in a scene that i forget what country i'm in. although maybe the deepest pleasure working with language is figuring out what to leave unsaid. in the alley scene in the novel, one of the characters brings a gun. i went back and forth about whether to have the presence of the gun discussed or have the fact revealed some other way, without words. after a gun goes off in a scene, what was left unsaid — beforehand — creates its own kind of rapture.

elements of magical realism are present, particularly the descriptions of beatriz yagoda's novels offered by your characters. what is your relationship to the genre? was engaging with that tradition important to you?

i'm resistant to aligning myself with that term because it refers to a very specific time in latin american literature. i see myself writing more in the american tradition of writers like denis johnson or george saunders or karen russell who experiment with a kind of slippery realism. in johnson's ""jesus' son,"" one story begins in a hospital that feels familiar enough until a character yanks a large object out of a patient's eye and it works out. the patient lives. johnson moves in and out of realism in such a slippery, unpredictable way in that book. it's exhilarating to read.

is there any work in translation you've read recently that deserves mention here?

the french writer marie ndiaye's ""self portrait in green"" is phenomenal. talk about a master of slippery realism. i'm really looking forward to her new novel coming out this spring.

do you have another novel in the works or will you return to poetry? translation?

i hope to continue moving between genres and languages for the rest of my life. i recently published a story about a headless chicken that first occurred to me 15 years ago when i was living in chile. i go back to chile every year with my family and something about that headless chicken, the menace of it, would not leave me until i finally wrote it down. the woman climbing into the almond tree at the beginning of ""ways to disappear"" was like that. once i saw her with her suitcase and her cigar, climbing onto the lowest branch, vanishing as so many women writers before her have, i knew i had to find out why.

a’s outburst against felix hernandez wasted; seattle sweeps

sean manaea was terrific through much of his second big-league outing, and oakland knocked out longtime nemesis felix hernandez before he had retired a batter in the fifth inning wednesday.

such pleasant developments for the a’s, though, weren’t enough to prevent a seattle sweep, because the bullpen, a strength through the first five weeks, couldn’t hold the lead in a 9-8 loss.

“that’s the most damage we’ve done off felix since i’ve been here, maybe ever,” oakland catcher stephen vogt said. “it was huge to chase him from the game and unfortunately, we didn’t take advantage. it’s beyond frustrating.”

the a’s bullpen had given up only one run over its previous 181/3 innings and had allowed no more than one run in 22 of the team’s first 28 games. ryan dull then gave up two runs, sean doolittle another two and john axford one as the a’s lost their fourth in a row and for the ninth time in 12 games.

axford had allowed only one run in his first 11 outings. doolittle hadn’t given up a run in his past eight appearances.

“it’s just unfortunate it all happened to all of us on the same day,” axford said.

with two outs in the fifth, the mariners finally got to manaea, starting with a little infield single by nori aoki that eluded jed lowrie. that was the first of five consecutive hits off manaea, including a gargantuan two-run homer by nelson cruz over the suites in center field.

“after that single with two outs, they gained a lot of momentum. i should have done a better job of calming things down and taking my time,” manaea said.

by the end of the inning, the mariners led 4-2, but in the bottom of the inning, oakland sent 11 men to the plate and scored six times. hernandez lasted just four-plus innings, matching his shortest start ever against the a’s, in no small part because of some dreadful defense, including his own. he misplayed a tapper by josh reddick, allowing one run to score, and kyle seager couldn’t come up with a hard grounder down the third-base line by khris davis on which two runners scored.

dull took the mound in the sixth. the mariners struck almost immediately: dae-ho lee smacked a one-out homer and leonys martin had a bunt single, stole second, took third on vogt’s throwing error and scored on a sacrifice fly by aoki.

in the seventh, doolittle walked robinson cano and wild pitched him to second; he scored on a base hit by seager. in came axford, who, with two outs, gave up another lee homer.

hernandez, who allowed a season-high eight runs (four earned), entered the day 22-8 with a 2.58 career era against oakland. marcus semien belted a one-out homer off hernandez in the third, semien’s team-high seventh.

“we finally get some hits, some good swings, make him work, get some runs off him and kind of let him off the hook,” manager bob melvin said of hernandez. “so disappointing.”

the first-place mariners have won their past seven at the coliseum. “it was a crazy win for us,” hernandez said. “it was unbelievable.”

mr. cowles, who had long suffered from cancer, was 82 years old and had homes in manhattan, southampton, and florida.

a liberal republican and internationalist, he was for many years an influential voice in urging the united states to move away from isolationism and toward a more active role in world affairs.

in 1942 he accompanied wendell l. willkie on the journey around the world that inspired the latter's book ''one world,'' which helped to win republican support for the wartime policies of president franklin d. roosevelt. later mr. cowles championed such causes as american recognition of china's communist government.

it was through his publications that he exerted his greatest influence, especially through look, a mass-circulation, general-interest magazine that, among other issues, focused early attention on the civil rights movement. he made his mark professionally as an innovative and aggressive creator of magazines.

began career in des moines

mr. cowles was born in 1903 in algona, iowa. his father, gardner cowles, thought he looked irish and so nicknamed him mike, which he thought sounded irish.

after growing up in des moines and graduating from phillips exeter academy and harvard university, mr. cowles returned to iowa in the mid-1920's to begin his career at the des moines register and tribune, the newspaper base established by his father. the register's financial success made possible the cowles family's expansion into other areas of communications.

mr. cowles and his older brother, john, aggressively acquired radio stations during the 1930's, and in 1935 the family bought the minneapolis star and john cowles moved to minneapolis to manage it.

during this period he became persuaded that a national picture magazine could be a great success, in part because of opinion polls by george gallup, then a graduate student at the university of iowa. henry luce, the founder of time, had a similar idea.

mr. luce's magazine was life, started in 1936, and mr. cowles's was look, which came out in early 1937. both magazines quickly became successful and bitter rivals, prompting mr. luce to buy stock in look.

a move to new york

though originally published in des moines as a monthly picture magazine, look soon switched to biweekly publication and in 1940 moved its corporate headquarters to new york. mr. cowles, however, continued to supervise its operations from des moines, where he managed the family paper.

during world war ii mr. cowles took a leave from publishing to become deputy director of the office of war information. after the war he left des moines for new york to devote his full energies to look, though he retained the title of president of the des moines register and tribune company.

in the next two decades, mr. cowles started a number of unsuccessful magazines, including quick, a pocket-sized news digest that failed because advertisers did not like its size, and flair, a chic and lavishly produced women's magazine that was guided by mr. cowles's third wife, fleur fenton. flair foundered after being hailed as ahead of its time.

among the other publications started by mr. cowles that proved to be costly failures were venture, a hard-cover travel magazine, and the suffolk sun, a daily newspaper intended to share the long island market with newsday.

but there were also very successful investments.

in 1959, mr. cowles founded puerto rico's first english-language daily, the san juan star, and it won a pulitzer prize for editorial writing during its first year. later he bought the monthly supermarket magazine family circle for $3.5 million in stock, as well as several newspapers and television stations. other acquisitions included television stations in memphis and orlando, fla., several florida newspapers and florida real estate.

in the mid-1960's, look, which had become more a feature publication with photographs than a picture book, passed its rival life in circulation, reaching 8.5 million.

cowles communications, the corporation created by mr. cowles that was listed on the new york stock exchange, reached its peak in the late 1960's. at that time its holdings included look, family circle, a group of trade magazines, a cluster of small newspapers in florida, television stations in orlando-daytona beach, fla., memphis and des moines, a cable television system, and the cambridge book company, a book publisher.

but at the same time television's seizure of the national advertising that had been look's principal source of revenue prompted a financial crisis at the magazine and at other mass-market magazines: collier's, the saturday evening post, and life.

to keep look operating, mr. cowles sold several of the company's other properties, including family circle, florida newspapers, a book division and the memphis television station, to the new york times company for about 23 percent of the times company's outstanding stock. the stock, which had limited voting power, was then valued at $50 million. mr. cowles was a director of the times company from 1971 to 1974.

despite his efforts, look continued to lose money, and it stopped publishing in 1971. a few months later the original weekly life folded, but it has since been revived as a monthly magazine.

''it was the most difficult day of my life,'' mr. cowles said later, referring to his announcement of look's last issue.

after that he progressively shed his business responsibilities, and in 1978 he dissolved cowles communications, the umbrella corporation for the companies he had assembled around look. the block of new york times stock was dispersed among the many stockholders of cowles communications.

in recent years mr. cowles devoted himself mainly to overseeing the cowles charitable trust, which has a net worth of $11 million.

a week ago the sale of the des moines register and tribune company to the gannett company became final. the sale left cowles media, the company formed around the family's newspapers in minnneapolis, as the only remaining branch of the family empire.

associates described mr. cowles as a man who leavened seriousness about the quality of his publications and his interests in the arts, politics and many other fields with a sense of fun and offbeat humor.

for many years he kept in his living room the cardiff giant, a stone statue once viewed by experts as evidence that a race of giants once roamed north american, though it was exposed later as a hoax. he also took wry pride in the fact that each of his three divorces was announced on the front page of the register and tribune.

mr. cowles served on the board of overseers of harvard university and was a trustee of many other schools, including columbia university teachers college, the university of miami and drake university.

he is survived by his wife, jan; three daughters, lois harrison of lakeland, fla.; kate nichols of tallahassee, fla., and virginia kurtis of new york city; a son, gardner 3d, of stony brook, l.i., and a stepson, charles, of new york city.

a memorial service is being planned.

but there is a very real pain behind their generosity.

their four-year-old granddaughter, katelyn, suffers from dravet syndrome, a potentially fatal childhood epilepsy condition.

since she was six months old, katelyn has suffered from agonising, debilitating seizures. one occurred in a hospital emergency room and lasted more than two hours, with doctors powerless to stop it.

it was this cruel condition, and memories of the loss of their own young daughter to another rare condition decades ago, that spurred the lamberts to make one of the largest medical donations in australian history when mr lambert sold his business count financial to the commonwealth bank for more than $370 million last year.

that money has been used to establish what is now the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics.

mr lambert told 60 minutes reporter allison langdon, “if you can afford it, why not.”

“this is not just for katelyn, this is for a whole range of various conditions,” he said.

“that’s what the research is about, so doctors will be medically convinced.

“we’re just doing what’s right.”

another person also desperate to ease katelyn’s suffering, is her father michael lambert, barry and joy’s son.

he has turned to cannabis oil to help his young daughter deal with her illness.

“it clears her mind, it’s making her less drowsy, less confused,” he said.

“raw cannabis is not psychoactive, it doesn’t make you high.”

the family agrees, saying the results have been remarkable.

“from the first day she improved,” mrs lambert told langdon.

“she got clear in her mind, she wanted to do more.

“she was more active and she was happier.”

michael is now growing his own cannabis crops and is facing drugs charges.

he is fighting them in court but is unrepentant, calling the treatment a “medical necessity”.

he said he will continue to seek conventional medical treatment for katelyn, who will still take clinically proven medicines.

“you can’t make a father watch his daughter die,” he said.

wells said it earned $5.6 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $5.8 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the same period a year earlier. the results beat analysts’ expectations of $1.01 per share.

the san francisco-based bank is being roiled by a crisis that ultimately toppled its ceo this week. wells reached a $185 million settlement with regulators last month following allegations that its employees opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts without their customers’ authorization in order to meet sales goals.

under pressure from politicians and investors, the bank’s long-time ceo, john stumpf, abruptly retired on wednesday. chief operating officer tim sloan was named to replace him. that has not stopped politicians like sen. elizabeth warren, d-massachusetts, to call for wells to be criminally charged for defrauding its customers.

‘‘i am deeply committed to restoring the trust of all of our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, and community partners,’’ sloan said in a statement. ‘‘we know that it will take time and a lot of hard work to earn back our reputation, but i am confident because of the incredible caliber of our team members. we will work tirelessly to build a stronger and better wells fargo for generations to come.’’

it is too early to see the total, long-term impact the scandal will have on wells’ bottom line, since most of the developments from the scandal broke in mid-to-late september, when the quarter was nearly over. the bank had noticeably higher non-interest expenses in the quarter, due partly to the $185 million settlement.

in the branches, there were signs that customers were backing away from the bank. in a presentation to investors released friday, wells reported a drop in what it calls banker and teller ‘‘interactions’’ in september from both a year ago and from august, the month before the scandal broke. consumer checking account openings dropped by 25 percent in september from a year earlier and 30 percent from august. consumer applications for wells credit cards also fell sharply in september.

in other parts of wells’ business, the bank said referrals for mortgages from their retail branches were down 24 percent from august. retail branch referrals account for 10 percent of all wells’ mortgage originations. wells is the nation’s largest mortgage lender.

wells fargo community banking franchise, the bank’s largest division and the business at the center of the scandal, had net income in the quarter of $3.23 billion compared with $3.56 billion in the same period a year. the bank drew loans and deposits in the quarter from a year ago.

wells’ wholesale banking division, which consists of wells’ investment bank, lending to companies and others, reported net income of $2.04 billion in the quarter, up from $1.93 billion a year earlier.

wells fargo revenue in the quarter was $22.33 billion, up 2 percent from a year earlier."

a mob-controlled owner of the popular ranch 1 fast-food chain cooked up a unique recipe for laundering cash - he used a brooklyn yeshiva to hide the origin of bribes paid in a multimillion-dollar mafia stock fraud scheme, according to fbi tapes.

james chickara, co-owner of the ranch 1 chain, has been captured on the undercover recordings saying he used the mesivta yeshiva rabbi chaim berlin on coney island ave. to launder bribes paid to brokers in the stock scams.

chickara and sebastian rametta, who the fbi says are associates of the colombo crime family, were co-owners of ranch 1 when they were arrested in june in a mammoth ""mob on wall street"" bust.

both men quietly pleaded guilty to stock fraud in manhattan federal court three weeks ago. rametta faces up to a year in jail, chickara up to 16 months.

the school is run by abraham fruchthandler, a politically connected real estate developer.

an assistant of fruchthandler, who has donated more than $22,000 to political candidates in the last four years, said he would not comment.

in their march 29 plea before judge william pauley, rametta and chickara admitted hiding an inflated commission paid to a broker to hype stock of their food retailer, manhattan soup man, which they modeled on ""the soup nazi"" character of the tv sitcom ""seinfeld.""

in talks secretly taped by the fbi, chickara said that he twice wrote checks to the brooklyn yeshiva and that school president fruchthandler tapped into yeshiva bank accounts to give cash back.

the yeshiva got a fee for its services, and chickara and rametta were able to claim a tax deduction for charitable giving, according to a talk secretly recorded dec. 14, 1999, between chickara and an informant named jeffrey pokross.

""we donated money to his yeshiva,"" chickara said. ""let's say we gave him a $100,000 check. ... out of the yeshiva, he gave me back $75,000 or $80,000, actually $80,000 in cash.""

pokross: ""and you get the tax deduction?""

before their arrest, rametta was listed as ranch 1's ceo and chickara as its vice chairman. since then, they have been removed from the executive suite, though rametta continues working as a ranch 1 consultant and both still own stock in the firm.

the company owns 60 restaurants, including 23 in new york city, selling what it terms healthy fast food such as flame-broiled chicken sandwiches. current ceo george naddaff said the company had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by rametta and chickara.

rametta's lawyer, edward little, noted that in accepting his client's plea, prosecutors agreed to drop the mob-related racketeering charges.

little also questioned whether chickara actually laundered money through the yeshiva, though he couldn't say it didn't happen.

chickara's lawyer, robert gage, did not return calls seeking comment.

the guilty pleas tarnished the image of respectability the men have carefully maintained in cobbling together several multimillion-dollar business deals over the last decade.

the two sold arnie's bagelicious bagels to quaker oats in 1994, took the profits and started ranch 1 in 1996. they brought in several big-name investors, including john sculley, former ceo of apple computers.

at the same time, according to tapes made by the fbi, they were hanging around gangsters from the brooklyn neighborhood where they grew up.

in a jan. 26, 2000, taped conversation, chickara said he and rametta had ""been around"" anthony (gaspipe) casso, the homicidal ex-underboss of the luchese crime family.

after casso was arrested, chickara said on the tape, he and rametta became associated with william (wild bill) cutolo, a colombo capo who disappeared in 1999.

by last year, rametta and chickara were working with bonanno crime family capo robert (little robert) lino to take ranch 1 and manhattan soup man public in a mob-orchestrated pump-and-dump scheme, according to court papers.

on tape, chickara said the mob would do well in the deal. he noted that his mafia handlers got a $500,000 payment when they sold arnie's bagels to quaker oats and said the colombo crime family stood to profit from ranch 1 and manhattan soup man as well.

""they'll make money with ranch 1, they'll make money with soup,"" chickara said. ""basically, anything we do, we try to give them something. and always to stay on good terms.""

in describing how he laundered cash as part of a mafia stock fraud scheme, a former ranch 1 executive said he used a religious school as the conduit and netted a hefty tax break in the process. here's how he said the scheme worked:

1 write a check for a charitable donation to a yeshiva called mesivta yeshiva rabbi chaim berlin on coney island ave. in brooklyn. the yeshiva is run by a friend.

2 the friend gives back 80% of the check in cash. the yeshiva keeps 20% as a fee.

3 pay off brokers and stock promoters with the cash. brokers hype worthless stock until its value crests, then insiders sell off, sending the stock crashing. this is called pump and dump.

4 the ranch 1 executive claims a tax break for the charitable donation to the yeshiva."

as a thin person who hasn't put any effort into being thin, i've never gotten much sympathy about gaining weight or feeling out of shape. that's all about to change. i got my body fat tested last month.

on the surface, nothing is different. i still appear thin and fit. but according to the national institutes of health, with a body-fat percentage of 32.4, i'm on the verge of being classified as overfat and slipping into high risk for serious health problems.

most people are aware that even when weight remains stable, an increase in body fat is associated with a higher risk of obesity, which can trigger heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke. dieters have learned that muscle weighs more than fat, making the bathroom scale an imprecise gauge of physical fitness.

which is where body-fat gauges come in. the first system that attempted to measure body fat was the body mass index (bmi), a formula created by the centers for disease control based on height and weight. bmi is considered a good indicator of body-fat percentage - heavy people tend to have high body fat - but does not produce an exact number and often classifies very muscular people as obese.

coming to a gym near you

""a major league athlete was referred to us for weight loss because they thought his bmi was too high,"" says dr. steven heymsfield, deputy director of the new york obesity research centre at st. luke's-roosevelt hospital, ""and it turned out he had virtually no fat at all.""

to distinguish between fat and muscle, calipers and densitometry (underwater weighing) have been standard for more than a decade. more recently, dxa, an x-ray that measures bone density and fat, and bioimpedance analysis (bia) have been introduced.

no method is perfect. calipers, which determine fat percentages by pinching layers of skin, can be painful and are often administered by untrained gym staffers. caliper readings were found to be off by 50% in a recent good housekeeping institute test.

while currently considered the gold standard, underwater weighing (about $150) is time-consuming and uncomfortable. subjects must expel as much air as possible from their lungs and sit completely still while submerged in a tank of water, a process that may be repeated several times.

dxa (about $300) is simple and highly accurate but involves radiation, which most of us would prefer to avoid in a body-fat test. the bia method (about $35), based on the electrical conductivity of water-filled muscles versus fat, sends small electrical currents through the soles of the feet. though this is quick and easy, bloating can cause bia inaccuracies. because the current only goes as far as the hips, those with heavy middles may get incorrect results.

with the exception of the caliper and bmi, all methods are administered in a lab. combination fat analyzers and scales, manufactured by companies such as taylor and tanita, are good options for getting an approximate fat-percentage reading at home. the taylor 5553, found to be the most accurate by the good housekeeping institute, costs $49.99.

i was tested in a bod pod, a $35,000 egg-shaped chamber that measures body fat by means of air-displacement plethysmograph - in other words, how much air your body displaces. ""a way to accurately, simply and safely test body fat has been unavailable to the medical community until now,"" says tom macleod, ceo of life measurement, inc., manufacturer of the bod pod. ""our device is underwater weighing without the water.""

the test, which costs about $125 (generally not covered by insurance), was administered at st. luke's-roosevelt hospital. after arriving at the body composition lab, i changed into a bathing suit, bathing cap and small booties, and removed all my jewelry. any extraneous material can contribute to errors.

after my height and weight were measured, i stepped inside the bod pod, which feels like a cross between a photo booth and sigourney weaver's spaceship bed in the ""alien."" the door was sealed and i sat still and breathed normally for about 60 seconds, occasionally hearing air rush into the pod. i was comfortable, but claustrophobics and people over 350 pounds or 7 feet should choose another method.

my results were printed by the attached computer within minutes. the report included my fat and lean body percentage, plus a breakdown of my fat and lean weight in pounds.

testing your body fat in a bod pod is simple and quick, but there aren't many available in the new york area. besides the machine at st. luke's-roosevelt, there are bod pods at brooklyn college and syracuse university. in other parts of the country, bod pods are being made available to the public via mobile service. the simpler bod pod st, which can produce a fast fat-percentage result but cannot store or manipulate data, is less expensive and should begin to appear in high-end gyms this year.

if you're interested in a bod pod appointment, or for more information, call 1-800-426-3763, or visit www.bodpod.com."

it's a jarring, but instructive, coincidence: the same week warner home video releases a dvd set with all the original season's episodes of ""the jetsons,"" cartoon network revisits george and his space age family in a less-than-futuristic episode of ""harvey birdman, attorney at law.""

the ""back to the present"" episode of ""harvey birdman,"" premiering sunday night at 11, is a riot. the 24-episode dvd set of ""the jetsons,"" (four disks, $64.92), is a minor revelation.

after william hanna and joseph barbera struck prime-time gold in 1960 with ""the flintstones,"" which translated ""the honeymooners"" into prehistoric animation, they tried again with ""the jetsons.""

the show imagined a future world - set in far-off 2002 - where meals were cooked by pushing a button, sidewalks moved while people stood still, tv was projected on giant screens, and people were whisked from one location to another via pneumatic glass tubes.

okay, so they were wrong about the tubes.

but unlike ""the simpsons,"" an animated prime-time series that remains far and away the best-selling title on dvd, the old ""jetsons"" episodes don't reward repeated viewings. they punish them.

a more rewarding venture is ""harvey birdman, attorney at law."" three years ago, hanna-barbera optioned the rights to the characters in ""birdman"" - a very mature cartoon built around a character from a very immature hanna-barbera series.

a little history may help: in 1967, a few years after launching ""jetsons"" in prime time on abc (where it lasted one season), hanna-barbera presented a vapid saturday-morning series on nbc. it was called ""birdman and the galaxy trio,"" and featured winged heroes trying to save the world.

birdman was a b-level hero even by hanna-barbera standards, so ""harvey birdman, attorney at law"" creators michael ouweleen and erik richter had no problem reimagining him as a suit-wearing, wing-sporting defense attorney, taking on cases brought to him by various characters in the hanna-barbera universe.

the best of these, from early in the run, reimagined fred flintstone as a mob boss, complete with an opening sequence that married those from ""the flintstones"" and ""the sopranos."" (its title: ""dabba-dabba-don."")

for sunday's ""harvey birdman,"" harvey is visited by the jetsons, who travel to harvey's time period to sue everyone for ruining the planet.

""we're from the future,"" george explains. ""the magnificent, far-off year of 2002.""

well, that is the 21st century, and george doesn't quite get - but audiences will - how the imagined future of ""the jetsons"" at times hasn't even kept pace with our own reality.

george provides harvey, for example, with a giant stack of evidence he claims will support his lawsuit.

""punch cards,"" he explains helpfully, taking a condescending tone. ""in the future, that's how we input data into machines we call computers.""

that's what i call funny.

and that's just what i don't call the original ""jetsons."" for now, save your money on the dvd set. maybe it'll be on sale, in the discount bins, in the very near future."

"zawiya, libya — dozens of opposition fighters surrounded libya's last functioning oil refinery wednesday and laid siege to about 100 government troops, part of a push which brought them closer to seizing this strategic western city. a rebel victory in zawiya could be a turning point in the six-month-old war and leave moammar gadhafi nearly cornered in his increasingly isolated stronghold of tripoli, the capital, just 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the east along the mediterranean coast. wednesday's fighting focused around the sprawling refinery complex on the western outskirts of zawiya, a city of 200,000. the troops barricaded themselves in and positioned snipers on rooftops. an oil engineer in the compound told the ap that about 100 gadhafi soldiers remained inside late wednesday afternoon. at least several dozen rebel fighters were also in the area. since then, they have taken control of 70 percent of the city, rebel commanders say, and have been slowly gaining ground in fierce battles with gadhafi's forces. arusi said rebels wanted to take the refinery undamaged, and have been negotiating with gadhafi soldiers inside the refinery since entering zawiya on saturday. about half a mile south of the refinery, an ap reporter saw two cars carrying civilians driving away from the refinery on an otherwise deserted road.

wednesday's fighting focused around the sprawling refinery complex on the western outskirts of zawiya, a city of 200,000. the rebels, who began their assault on the refinery a day earlier, took control of the facility's three-story administration building, tearing down the gadhafi regime's green flag that flew over the grounds.

desperate gadhafi troops cut off from the main government forces took cover in a residential compound and closed the gates to prevent workers from fleeing, rebels said. the troops barricaded themselves in and positioned snipers on rooftops. an associated press photographer inside the refinery with rebel troops heard occasional bursts of gunfire.

an oil engineer in the compound told the ap that about 100 gadhafi soldiers remained inside late wednesday afternoon. at least several dozen rebel fighters were also in the area. arusi said his forces controlled parts of the complex.

the libyan rebels made a dramatic advance on saturday out of their bases in the western mountains near tunisia into zawiya on the mediterranean coast. since then, they have taken control of 70 percent of the city, rebel commanders say, and have been slowly gaining ground in fierce battles with gadhafi's forces.

the clashes at the refinery began on tuesday, then opposition fighters pulled out at nightfall and made a new push after daybreak, arusi said.

arusi said rebels wanted to take the refinery undamaged, and have been negotiating with gadhafi soldiers inside the refinery since entering zawiya on saturday. he said on tuesday morning, some of the regime fighters, all locals, surrendered to the rebels after several days of negotiations.

the remaining gadhafi loyalists closed the gate of the residential compound for refinery workers and their families. it was unclear how many people were living there. many of the workers were evacuated early in the civil war, which began in mid-february.

""if (the civilians) leave, we can deal with gadhafi's guys with full force,"" arusi said. ""so gadhafi's guys don't want them to leave. they keep them as protection.""

about half a mile south of the refinery, an ap reporter saw two cars carrying civilians driving away from the refinery on an otherwise deserted road. meanwhile, three pickup trucks loaded with fighters sped toward the refinery along the same road, to reinforce the troops.

a rebel field commander in zawiya, osama arusi, said the clashes at the refinery shut down an oil pipeline to tripoli, where a third of libya's 6 million people live.

""the pipeline from zawiya to tripoli has been switched off,"" arusi told the associated press. ""the man who is responsible for switching the pipeline off said it is not working.""

neither a pipeline shutdown nor a capture of the 120,000 barrel-per-day refinery in zawiya would have a major impact on gadhafi's ability to secure fuel, analysts said.

the flow of crude to the refinery from fields in the southwest of libya had largely halted since midsummer. the refinery was believed to be running at about one-third of its normal capacity, drawing mainly on crude oil that was in its storage tanks. at any rate, zawiya produces mostly fuel oil, not gasoline, which gadhafi had trucked in mainly from tunisia and to a lesser extent algeria.

""in that sense, it's more significant that they (the rebels) have got control of the roads than the refinery,"" said john hamilton, a libya energy expert with cross-border information and a contributing editor of africa energy. ""strategically, that's a more important gain for the rebels. having control of the roads makes it much harder for gadhafi to get the petrol he needs"" from tunisia and algeria.

in fighting elsewhere in the west, more than 45 wounded rebel fighters arrived in tunisia for medical care over the past 24 hours through the zintan border crossing, tunisia's official tap news agency reported.

outside the rebel-held city of misrata east of tripoli, opposition fighters said they captured the town of haysha, located halfway between misrata and gadhafi's hometown of sirte on the mediterranean coast. haysha was used by gadhafi forces as a base to fire rockets on misrata.

on the eastern front of the civil war, hundreds of miles from zawiya around the coastal town of brega, rebels clashed with gadhafi troops for control of the town's oil refinery. the front lines have swept through brega several times, and the oil facility there has not been operating for months.

a rebel doctor in brega, mohammed idris, said the field hospital in brega was overwhelmed by the number of casualties and that many wounded were sent to benghazi for treatment.

he said that at least 18 rebels had been killed and 74 wounded in fighting tuesday.

rebel fighter moussa ahmaid, who was escorting the wounded rebels to the hospital, said the fighting was mainly on the southern side of brega.

""we are using light hand-held weapons and mortars,"" he told the ap. ""most of our casualties are from sniper fire or shrapnel from shelling.""

it is exactly three years since economic woes began to dominate the minds of the british electorate, and such concerns show no sign of diminishing. according to the latest the economist/ipsos-mori poll, 59% of people identified the economy as one of the most important issues facing the country today.

meanwhile concerns about unemployment have crept up to second place, causing concern for 30% of the population. fears have been exacerbated by rising joblessness that has particularly affected the young.

the official unemployment rate for people aged under 25 in the three months to july was 20% (the poll was conducted before more recent, and equally concerning, figures were published on september 13th). the complete picture is a little less awful than portrayed because the unemployment rate is calculated as percentage of those who are either in work or looking for it, which excludes the many youngsters (almost half the population) who are in higher education. as a percentage of all those under 25, unemployment was about 13%—worrying but not terrifying.

still, the issue is at its most vexed since july 2009, six months after the start of the recent recession. unemployment lags behind economic trends, as struggling businesses shed staff or slow down any new recruitments. as the economy falters, the quest for jobs looks set to become a long one."

as the wall street journal reports, aol is in talks to sell icq, the once prominent — but now archaic — instant messaging service. the wall street journal also says that bebo, the social network aol acquired in 2008 for a jaw-dropping $850 million, may be on the block. in the ensuing 20 months, bebo hasn’t quite turned out to be the profit center aol hoped it would be. although traffic was up after a redesign in february, bebo has continued to languish as european users migrate to facebook, like the rest of the world.

spending nearly $1 billion on bebo — which at this point is nearly a third of aol’s valuation as a separate entity — was just one of many, many missteps for the former web titan.

with icq, the situation is a bit less embarrassing. aol acquired icq in 1998 for $287 million. at the time, icq was a huge competitor to aol’s aim service, which had only recently become available to non-aol subscribers. the wall street journal says that icq’s potential buyer, facebook investor digital sky technologies, could pay as much as $300 million for the service. that’s not bad for a service that has never had a strong association with the aol brand.

it’s fascinating how quickly armstrong is making moves to streamline aol into a leaner, more focused company. what are you thoughts on the new aol? where does the bebo acquisition rank in the company’s long line of bad business moves?"
washington — interest rates on short-term treasury bills fell in monday’s auction with rates on three-month bills dropping to their lowest level in three weeks. the six-month rate was the lowest since those bills averaged 0.060 percent on oct.,"washington — interest rates on short-term treasury bills fell in monday’s auction with rates on three-month bills dropping to their lowest level in three weeks.

the treasury department auctioned $35 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 0.035 percent, down from 0.130 percent last week; $30 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 0.070 percent, down from 0.150 percent last week.

the three-month rate was the lowest since three-month bills averaged 0.010 percent on sept. 30. the six-month rate was the lowest since those bills averaged 0.060 percent on oct. 7.

for a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,999.120 while a six-month bill sold for $9,996.46. that would equal an annualized rate of 0.035 percent for the three-month bills and 0.071 percent for the six-month bills.

although the new software won’t be formally released until next year, analysts already consider its success crucial for microsoft and satya nadella, who has made mobile devices and internet-based services priorities since becoming chief executive in february.

with its tablet-like touch controls, windows 8 had been microsoft’s answer to slumping sales in personal computers amid a rising demand for mobile devices. but the company alienated many users by forcing radical behavioral changes. research firm idc even blamed windows 8 for accelerating a decline in pc sales in the first full quarter following the system’s release in october 2012.

microsoft has released updates that address some of the complaints, yet analytics firm net applications estimates that five out of six windows users are still using something other than windows 8.

the next major release will be the company’s chance to regain its footing and show it can embrace mobile devices without sacrificing the traditional computing experience.

‘‘it’s one of the most important launches that they will ever have,’’ said patrick moorhead at the research firm moor insights and strategy. ‘‘it’s very important they get it right.’’

microsoft is expected to give an early look at some new features tuesday during an event the company has billed as a discussion about ‘‘what’s next for windows.’’ the company hasn’t said what it plans to call the new windows version.

the san francisco event is geared toward the business market. separate sessions focused on home computer users and others will be held in the coming months. analysts say the sessions are part of an effort by microsoft to gather feedback and avoid the stumbles it made with windows 8.

even after two years of declining sales of personal computers, software licenses for windows remain a key revenue stream for microsoft. such sales are a part of a business segment that contributes roughly 21 percent of microsoft’s annual revenue — second only to sales of the company’s commercial software.

windows 8 introduced a host of features for personal computers, including touch-screen functions that are now common with tablets. many pc users, however, found the redesigned interface difficult to navigate, particularly with keyboards and mice on devices without touch screens. they also missed familiar controls, such as the ‘‘start’’ button that was a longtime component of previous windows systems.

‘‘it was a miscalculation on the part of microsoft,’’ said analyst steve kleynhans at the gartner research firm. ‘‘you can’t force people into a situation where everything they know changes.’’

still, experts say, microsoft has good reason to design software that attempts to broaden its appeal to smartphone and tablet users. although the company still dominates the pc industry, that market is barely growing. meanwhile, microsoft has gained little traction in a booming smartphone market dominated by apple’s iphones and devices running google’s android software.

nadella has said he wants the next version of windows to be a ‘‘single, converged operating system for screens of all sizes.’’"

one hundred million vehicles drive across the george washington bridge every year. i took it every time i drove home after practicing at the jets facility on long island. i'd take the cross island parkway to the throgs neck bridge to the cross bronx expressway to the gw, the busiest bridge in the world.

i was well acquainted with the george washington bridge, but i still felt i probably needed to drive it one more time. i needed to see it with a new set of eyes, not as a commuter looking to get home to his family, but as a man on a very different mission. i needed to find the best place along its mile-long span to drive my truck off the road and into the hudson river 200 feet below.

that was the basic plan. i just needed to iron out the specifics.

i got in my truck and drove to the bridge, as clear and coherent as i had been in months. i was living in the moment, my endorphins flowing. this was going to work out all right after all.

i crossed over into manhattan, scanning the possibilities provided by the upper level. all of a sudden, i was at the line of scrimmage, looking over the defense for a weakness one last time. i took note of the little guardrail that separated the pedestrian walkway from the four lanes of eastbound traffic.

this could make things a little tough.

so, i looped around and drove back the other way, heading west to fort lee. there's no westbound toll on the george washington bridge. things were looking up already.

the westbound side didn't appear to have any more favorable options. it looked challenging, but not impossible.

good idea. i needed to check the lower level. once i got back into jersey, i turned around and did another loop of the bridge. i was really getting into this fact-finding expedition. i was laughing to myself and smiling. i even started to break into a little sweat.

but the lower level was no good -- steel support beams in an unbroken pattern of upright triangles all the way across. i couldn't have blasted my truck through those. i checked the lower level on the way back, too, just to be sure. same deal.

guess it's going to have to be the upper level.

guess so. but i needed to do one more lap, just to make sure. i wound up making three consecutive round trips across the george washington bridge in a red truck that day, and no one noticed. you would've thought someone would have found this slightly suspicious and pulled my ass over. no one gets so lost that they do three laps around the gw.

but no one stopped me. must have been my lucky day.

after exiting the upper level for the third and final time, i headed home to harrison.

i'd planned my work. soon, it'd be time to work my plan.

i would go on sunday morning, after cecy and our three girls left for church. i would drive to the gw, take the upper level approach, get through the tolls and the merge from 12 lanes down to four, pick a lane, and floor it. i knew i would need to pick up a high rate of speed, so that when i made my hard right, probably just beyond the halfway point, i'd have enough momentum to clear the guardrail, the pedestrian lane, and, finally, the outer guardrail. i figured my truck had the weight to carry me up and over, if i was going fast enough. as long as i didn't get caught up by one of the 592 steel suspender ropes that hold the bridge in place, i'd break through.

i figured somebody would see me go over. they'd see a red truck with jersey tags, maybe even catch a few numbers off my license plate. someone would be able to figure out who it was and get the news to my family.

i like it. let's go.

4— attorney general william french smith said today that a new federal task force created to investigate serious abuses in the food stamp program would focus initially on charges of massive fraud in new york city. officials in new york city's food stamp program have denied the charges. creation of the unit was disclosed yesterday by justice department officials.,"washington, sept. 4— attorney general william french smith said today that a new federal task force created to investigate serious abuses in the food stamp program would focus initially on charges of massive fraud in new york city.

mr. smith, in formally announcing creation of the unit, said that the justice department already had directed the united states attorneys for the southern and eastern districts of new york to intensify their efforts to identify and wipe out fraud in the federally financed program.

justice department officials said the unit was being formed partly as a reaction to reports that officials in new york city were unwilling to pursue fraud cases and had blocked the efforts of their own investigators.

several former and current investigators complained about lack of support from city officials in a meeting in washington on sunday with an associate attorney general, rudolph w. giuliani. officials in new york city's food stamp program have denied the charges.

the attorney general said that both united states attorneys' offices would receive additional investigative assistance from the federal bureau of investigation, the department of agriculture and the united states postal service.

creation of the unit was disclosed yesterday by justice department officials. d. lowell jensen, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, will oversee the nationwide effort. the fraud i nvestigation became anissue today in the new york city mayoral elect ion when a candidate in the democratic primary, state assemblyman f rank j. barbaro, used the food stamp reports to accuse mayor koch of covering up wrongdoing in the city's human resources administratio n. waste called 'staggering'

at a city hall news conference, mr. koch denied the charges and asserted that the city had taken steps last year to reduce the number of fraudulent food stamp claims each month from 12,500 to fewer than 100. the mayor also denied charges that city officials had harassed employees who sought to bring the controversy into the open.

the attorney general described as ''staggering'' the amount of fraud and waste in food stamp programs in new york and in other cities.

he said that government agencies have had ''many successes'' in combating fraud, and noted that 450 indictments had been brought this year. he added, however, that ''with the addtional resources i have now redeployed from the criminal division and the f.b.i., we can and will do more.''

one of the more important agencies that will be involved in the task force effort is the agriculture department. the 450 indictments noted by mr. smith were bought as a result of investigations by the department's inspector general.

the reagan administration has cut the number of employees in the inspector general's office to 880 from 930."

"men's clubs appear to be increasingly in the center of controversy these days -the question of female membership in particular has raised some hackles. not long ago a peer of the realm was upbraided by the committee of an old london club for handing another member a brochure depicting the joys of a vacation on the tunisian coast, to which he intended to repair. the late peter fleming, an amateur of social history, held that this rule was an extension of the duke of wellington's ukase against discussion of these subjects in an officers' mess on the ground that they were the most likely to lead to violent argument and ultimately a duel. one in london was once described as a quiet subbranch of the british museum. whether the food is good or bad, the wine is likely to be excellent. in some london clubs it is customary for elderly bachelors to will their wine cellars to their clubs. ''not in there, bet,'' said prince philip. that was the queen, my lord,'' a waiter said. '' one hot summer evening in the 60's, brendan behan, the distinguished irish playwright, descended from a taxi in front of an old and distinguished london club. naturally he had taken several rounds of what the indians called ''make brave'' to sustain him on the trip. the watchers were totally unequipped to deal with this. i've come about the bloody television,'' said behan. the professor asked behan one question and got a string of slurred obscenities in reply.","men's clubs appear to be increasingly in the center of controversy these days -the question of female membership in particular has raised some hackles. but i still regard them fondly. as a member at various times of six clubs in paris, london and new york and as a visitor to others in singapore, dublin, milwaukee, cairo, san francisco, boston and kuala lumpur, i have always found them to be places of comfort, where for a few hours one can escape the abrasions of business and the demands of family.

in fact, every club i know looks askance at the member or visitor who produces business papers. recently i heard a financial bigwig being told off by a club porter for attempting to introduce a portfolio into a club. not long ago a peer of the realm was upbraided by the committee of an old london club for handing another member a brochure depicting the joys of a vacation on the tunisian coast, to which he intended to repair.

an innocent author may be seduced by a couple of martinis fed him by an unusually generous publisher to accept a down payment on a book much below his original figure. (no records exist of a publisher raising the down payment after being bought a couple of drinks by an author, probably because very few authors are willing or able to risk the cost of two drinks on what manifestly is a very long shot.) but business is something most men go to clubs to escape.

conversations at a club may wander from the disturbing situation in poland to the jets' need to get back into the national football league race, but in most two subjects are barred: women and professional matters. the late peter fleming, an amateur of social history, held that this rule was an extension of the duke of wellington's ukase against discussion of these subjects in an officers' mess on the ground that they were the most likely to lead to violent argument and ultimately a duel.

club conversation, i have found, is often witty, informed and spiced with humor. within the confines of a club a senator, a cabinet minister or a cleric can relieve himself of that ''perilous stuff that weighs upon the soul.'' the speaker can be absolutely sure that what he says will not go beyond its walls. of course, the club member must take the rough with the smooth. every club i know has its bores, and often a chief bore, and the new member or visitor is warned against them.

the worst in my experience was a member of a london club known for the levity of its conversation. he once cornered dan macmillan, the former prime minister harold's elder brother, and began a long recital of his adventures in some tin-pot campaign in world war i.

when mr. macmillan showed signs of restiveness, the bore said aggrievedly, ''i don't think you want me to finish this story.'' ''that's exactly what i do want,'' said mr. macmillan. clubs vary as much as their members. one in london was once described as a quiet subbranch of the british museum. on a still day the snores emitted by high members of the clergy resting after lunch can be heard as far as piccadilly circus. it was the scene of one of the best club stories.

an eminent peer and former cabinet minister walked daily from his home in westminster to another, livelier club. en route it was his custom to use ''the facilities,'' as the british call them, in the quieter establishment. some members took umbrage. they objected to the sight of a nonmember, no matter how exalted, using their club in this manner. they instructed the hall porter, the figure around whom the workings of all clubs revolve, to inform the peer that it was a club he was using when next he stopped.

the porter did so. ''oh, it's a club, too, is it,'' said the peer, and departed. some clubs are learned. once, during world war ii, i listened in dublin's kildare street club to a most instructive dissertation on joyce's ''ulysses,'' given, with the aid of a couple of brandies, by a slightly motheaten professor. in the salisbury club in what was then rhodesia and is now zimbabwe, i heard two planters sketching the path of arab slave traders across their adjoining plantations. they cited a wealth of archeological and social data. they were not showing off; they were interested and hoped others would be.

club food, it must be admitted, is rarely distinguished. the wouldbe reformers who conjure up pictures of men wading through meals that would put brillat-savarin to shame are well off the mark.

a gifted cockney chef in a london club said he had discovered early in his career that it was no use tempting the members with high-toned productions or dainty tidbits.

''wot they wants,'' he said, ''is something wot sticks to their ribs; beef, lamb, grouse, salmon. good cheese. sometimes a strengthenin' drop of soup. but nothing fancy-like.''

whether the food is good or bad, the wine is likely to be excellent. in some london clubs it is customary for elderly bachelors to will their wine cellars to their clubs. the wine is sold at the price the deceased paid. in one club the members passed a memorable autumn drinking a chateau talbot of a superlative year at about $1.50 a magnum.

all clubs have territorial limits. the lounge of one in london is forbidden to all visitors. once in the 60's the queen arrived for a private dinner party and darted into the lounge to look at the pictures, which are memorable.

''not in there, bet,'' said prince philip. the queen left. an elderly member napping by the fire awoke and asked, ''who was that woman - what was she doing here?'' ''that was the queen, my lord,'' a waiter said. ''well, dammit, she shouldn't be here, members only you know.'' one hot summer evening in the 60's, brendan behan, the distinguished irish playwright, descended from a taxi in front of an old and distinguished london club. he had flown from dublin to london, which to him was a frightening experience. naturally he had taken several rounds of what the indians called ''make brave'' to sustain him on the trip. he had come to london to appear on a very cerebral bbc program devoted to the arts and was to meet his interlocutor, a member, at the club. as it happened, about a dozen of the club's elderly members had gathered around the television to watch the last match of the cricket series between england and australia, an event of transcendent interest, to be compared with the super bowl or the last game of the world series.

suddenly the television set went blank. the watchers were totally unequipped to deal with this. they telephoned at once for a repairman and the most senior of the group was deputized to go to the front door to escort the repairman to the set.

the taxi, at that moment, decanted behan, sweating profusely with his coat over his back. ''who are you?'' asked the clubman. ''i've come about the bloody television,'' said behan. he was immediately led to the set, where his ignorance of the machine was soon manifest. then it was learned that he had come to the club as a guest.

the cricket addicts had infringed one of clubland's basic laws; they had been rude to a guest of a member in the club. they had no recourse. behan was escorted to the bar where he was plied with strong drink, which he needed about as much as a second head. by the time he arrived at the bbc for his program he was in a sorry state.

the producer, also a member, reported the next day that it had been the shortest interview on record. the professor asked behan one question and got a string of slurred obscenities in reply. the bbc's reaction was rapid. as i recall it, the program was switched to an elevating film about roman ruins in britain.

"some say that the national voting rights act discriminates against the south. at present, before redistricting, there are 43 council seats, 8 held by blacks and hispanics. the council has taken a reckless gamble with orderly city government. even if the plan should survive washington's scrutiny, the council owes the city a thorough overhaul of its districting structure, including proposals to amend the city charter if necessary. meanwhile, does the voting rights law need to be renewed?","some say that the national voting rights act discriminates against the south. new york city is learning that it is binding in all respects in manhattan, brooklyn and the bronx. the city council has made such a mess of its 1981 redistricting that its plan probably violates the federal law. so the sept. 10 primary will be held under a legal cloud; even the november general election could be invalidated.

the numbers make their own eloquent point. at present, before redistricting, there are 43 council seats, 8 held by blacks and hispanics. but since 1970, the black and hispanic proportion of the population has risen from 24 percent to nearly 40 percent. so what does the council offer? a plan giving minorities 8 of 45 seats.

no wonder that this plan runs afoul of a guiding principle at the justice department, which must approve any new plan: minorities should be no worse off than before. the reagan administration applied that rule just last month in striking down a virginia legislative reapportionment.

the council, far from demonstrating that it is nondiscriminatory, has instead raised new questions. hence the justice department has called for detailed additional information.

the council's main justification is that minorities are too scattered among the boroughs to permit creating new minority districts. the justice reaction seems - not to put too fine a point on it - skeptical. citizen groups have charged that the council was much more interested in preserving the seats of incumbents, of whatever race, than in giving minorities a fair share of electoral power.

redistricting is complicated business, but the council was not confused. for instance, it drew the 25th district in brooklyn in such a way that the white incumbent, theodore silverman, who is chairman of the council's election committee, has a much better chance of keeping his seat. blacks were siphoned off to other districts and whites added so that his 84 percent black constituency became less than 60 percent.

the log-rolling goes in both directions. black and hispanic incumbents, having the same instinct for self-preservation as their white colleagues, went along with the council plan. it is doubly disappointing when not even they are dependable protectors of the political rights of minority voters. the voting rights act requires proof that the self-preservation is not bought at minorities' expense.

the council has taken a reckless gamble with orderly city government. even if the plan should survive washington's scrutiny, the council owes the city a thorough overhaul of its districting structure, including proposals to amend the city charter if necessary. meanwhile, does the voting rights law need to be renewed? new york may end up as exhibit a."

fact and logic were never allowed to intrude on her opinions. she was a stubborn woman and a bigoted one, fiercely independent, often less than pleasant, and capable of outright cruelty. she was also one of the most fascinating and powerful women of her time. the power diminished long before her death, the fascination lingers on. the first woman elected to the british house of commons, nancy astor is now a historical statistic, but she is a compelling one.

the complexities of her character are explored in detail in these two books, and for anyone interested but not committed to the subject, it's a toss-up as to which paints the better picture. both are objective and straightforward, and neither makes any attempt to burnish legend or gloss over imperfections. the lady who confronts us is very real, with as many warts as beauty spots. mass of contradictions

one of three beautiful langhorne sisters of virginia, nancy astor was a mass of contradictions and inconsistencies. a woman who disliked sex, she married twice and bore six children, to whom she was a dutiful, if not exemplary mother. the wife of one of the wealthiest men in britain, she enjoyed luxury but fought tirelessly for the poor. a passionate believer in temperance, she served the best brandies and wine to her guests, sometimes to their surprise. the late duke of windsor, while still prince of wales, was apparently prepared to bring his own spirits to cliveden, the astor estate, but refrained when his equerry was told that it would not be necessary to go to such lengths.

her friends were the great of the time - lord lothian, t.e. lawrence, lloyd george - and she hoarded them as a miser does gold, but tolerated no straying from her all-enveloping fold. she was, if not overtly anti-semitic, certainly inclined in that direction, a tendency aggravated by her friendship with the writer hilaire belloc. yet she is quoted as saying that eventually she had to give up belloc because he had two manias - against the jews and against the rich. which mania was uppermost in her decision is a moot point.

she disdained reason (one friend said ''reason was not a weapon she cared to use much, if at all'') for intuition and emotion. ''she was a very intelligent woman, but her intelligence was always more intuitive than cerebral,'' says mr. grigg. ''she had no capacity for organizing her thoughts, and her critical faculties, though in some ways very acute, were in other ways surprisingly limited.''

the author of a british broadcasting corporation television documentary on nancy astor, mr. grigg is perhaps the lighter and livelier writer of the two. it is to his credit that this in no way detracts from the substance of his book or the research that went into it. his access to letters written by lady astor to her sister phyllis, and the co-operation he received from the astor family, were obviously of immeasurable help, and although the result is both intimate and revealing, it is not prurient.

his own asides and comments are equally judicious, and often delightful. ''i am sure god meant us to use humility with discretion,'' he quotes lady astor as saying, and then comments, ''in that sense, if in no other, her discretion was impeccable.''

discussing nancy astor's friendship with george bernard shaw, he notes that ''gbs agreed to have his beard trimmed and washed by nancy's hairdresser, but did not cut his political opinions to suit hers.''

mr. masters's somewhat more scholarly book gives equal time to lady astor's childhood, marriages, feminism, political career and christian science beliefs, but it is particularly engrossing when it deals with the latter part of her life.

the motivation and background of the ''cliveden set,'' the british establishment figures who gathered at the astor home in the 1930's, and who were accused of fostering the appeasement of nazi germany, are explained perhaps as well as they ever will be.

''in fact, they were naive and over-optimistic,'' he says. ''for intellectual and non-violent people they were conspicuous in their ability to blind themselves to hitler's violence.'' an era portrayed

he paints, too, a vivid and poignant portrait of lady astor's declining years, her unwilling retirement from parliament in 1944, her partial estrangement from her husband and her subsequent rather aimless life.

there is an era portrayed here, as well as an individual. one charming vignette is of tea at cliveden, described by walter elliott, a favored guest and conservative parliamentary colleague, as having the ambiance of a bedouin encampment. he notes, too, that his hostess presided ''like a blend between juno at the siege of troy, and one of the leading valkyries caracoling over an appropriate battlefield.''

it's very likely that nancy astor would have enjoyed the description.

with cannon crossing miss havoc has parlayed her passion for preservation into a thriving business enterprise. unable to bear what she said was the ''sad disintegration'' of the area, she purchased eight acres of run-down buildings four years ago, converted them into a center of quaint antique and crafts shops, and rented them.

last year, the conversion was capped when miss havoc bought an old one-room school house (circa 1872) on route 7. with her flair for theatricality - and with a little help from 88 friends, accompanied by the wilton high school marching band - she had it moved over to cannon crossing, where it is now a restaurant.

she has a flair for self-promotion as well. in most of the shops, autographed copies of the second in miss havoc's series of autobiographical memoirs, ''more havoc,'' published by harper & row last year, are strategically displayed, inscribed ''with love.''

''early havoc,'' the first book, was about her beginnings in vaudeville at the age of two, and the squalid marathon days. her relationship with her predatory stage mother, rose, and her sister louise, who became gypsy rose lee, are explained in ''more havoc.'' a third book, ''ever havoc,'' is scheduled to be published.

miss havoc lives on six acres behind the shops, where she tends to her eight dogs, two burros, two goats, 22 chickens, 50 birds and the swans and geese she hasn't counted. ''they delight my heart,'' she said. ''they're my entertainment. some people go to nightclubs. i go to my menagerie.''

miss havoc continues to appear in movies and plays. but her most recent forays into film, ''can't stop the music,'') and theater, ''jitters,'' were flops. many referred to the film, released last year, as ''can't stand the music'' and the play, which was bound for broadway last month, closed en route, in philadelphia.

''that was a mystifying experience. it never happened to me before.'' she said. ''the play was very successful in little theaters'' - it played at the long wharf theater's stage 2 - ''but they didn't want to change anything to make it suitable for a broadway-size house,'' she maintained.

miss havoc bought her first house in weston 25 years ago, but it wasn't until 15 years later that she decided connecticut was home. ''i had a brownstone in the city and some depraved citizens came in an vandalized that beautiful 100-year-old building with all the rococo plaster and original brass rings and i felt violated,'' she said.

of her life in connecticut, she said: ''i never had neighbors before. i never knew who anybody was and i don't think i tried. i never was involved with anyone local and here i am. this is more than doing benefits. this is going to town meetings because you care where the ground fill is put and what happens to that river and you get up and fight for it.''

''cannon crossing has turned into something more satisfying than having anyone say 'i loved your book' or 'i saw your performance,' '' she said. ''this is my life.''"

''for years we had nothing but promises, promises, like the song in the broadway show,'' said jesse mistero, inwood's fire commissioner and a lifelong resident of the area. '' i wonder if the funds for all the planned improvements will really be made available.''","inwood local residents have long regarded this unincorporated community next to affluent lawrence in the five towns as the stepchild of the town of hempstead and the nassau county government. but now town officials have advised them that a long-range revitalization plan is in the works that will improve both the community's status and its economy.

the plan includes new housing, the renovation of commercial areas, the upgrading of recreational facilities and improvements in streets, sidewalks and lighting. according to eugene k. ferencik, deputy commissioner of the town's department of planning and economic development, $500,000 in community development funds will be spent for the first phase of a three-year project, and he is optimistic that there will be future funds for the project.

the revitalization plan is aimed at improving sections of inwood that are dilapidated and overrun with rubble, weeds and gutted buildings. the main target areas are expected to be doughty boulevard and bayview avenue, and lawrence avenue at the lawrence village line. groundbreaking is scheduled to begin next spring for 150 new housing units for the elderly and the handicapped. these will be called mary's manor.

mary's manor will rise on both east and west sides of doughty boulevard and will be managed by the halandia management corporation of oceanside. the human development office of the rockville centre roman catholic diocese and the town of hempstead jointly obtained more than $7 million in construction funds from the united states department of housing and urban development.

''we have built one development in selden'' - st. joseph's village - ''and this will be our second,'' said john gregory, the executive secretary of the human development office of the diocese.

thirteen one-family homes will be built on scatttered sites that have already been cleared. according to sandra victor, the director of urban renewal for the town of hempstead, a public hearing will be held tuesday on the model for the homes that are to be built by the halandia corporation.

as part of the housing-improvement plan, low-interest loans will be made available to homeowners who are interested in renovating properties in need of major repair. some people who cannot afford to borrow will receive outright grants.

the inwood revitalization project also calls for new businesses to come into the area to provide employment. one concern - an importexport company - has filed an application to build at sheridan boulevard; two other companies are expected to come into the area as well.

a spokesman for united states senator alfonse m. d'amato, republican, who started the project while he was hempstead town presiding supervisor, said, ''we are hoping to create a good climate for private business by upgrading the entire area.''

community leaders expressed optimism as well as some skepticism about the revitalization plan. sadie e. scott, the executive director of the five towns community center, said, ''the $500,000 is just a drop in the bucket because we've got a long way to go in order to improve our way of life here.''

''for years we had nothing but promises, promises, like the song in the broadway show,'' said jesse mistero, inwood's fire commissioner and a lifelong resident of the area. ''we had a history of being neglected by every level of government. however, i believe that at long last we're going to get action.''

''it's time our officials gave us cause to erase our self-image of neglect,'' said the rev. judith m. bennett, pastor of st. paul's united methodist church. ''i wonder if the funds for all the planned improvements will really be made available.''

mr. ferencik of the town planning department said that ''although the reagan administration has proposed cuts in h.u.d. funding, the federal funds to be used for this first phase of community development and housing were approved and allocated while the carter administration was still in office.''

two state legislators also expressed opinions on the subject. assemblyman arthur j. kremer, the long beach democrat who is chairman of the assembly's ways and means committee, said: ''it's not time to break out the champagne yet. i would urge the residents to take this news with guarded optimism.''

state senator carol berman, democrat of lawrence, said, ''it's about time that the town finally came through for this long-neglected area.''

local civic leaders say the major reason for inwood's decline as a community was a project known as the nassau expressway, which was planned by the state department of transportation more than 30 years ago but never built.

in an action that some local residents refer to as ''rockefeller's follies,'' the state condemned a large section of inwood for the expressway, forcing people to leave their homes, then abandoned the area. the area is now occupied largely by rats and weeds, a situation that owners of adjoining properties in the doughty boulevard area say has caused their parcels to decline in value.

the state department of transportation recently announced that it would seek federal funds to finally get the ''phantom roadway'' started."

these are the bankers of today. and the list goes on. need a loan? want to make a deposit? get a line of credit? sign up for a credit card, an auto loan, a second mortgage, a first mortgage? americans no longer need banks to satisfy their financial needs. nor are the banks themselves ''just banks'' any more. they are, or are trying to be, go-go financial marketers. they prefer to call themselves ''financial services companies,'' just like the american expresses and the merrill lynches.

the banks are even finding ways around federal laws that prohibit them from engaging in certain activities or branching across state lines. despite the glass-steagall act of 1933, which bars commercial banks from many investment banking activities, the bankamerica corp. recently announced that it planned to buy charles schwab & co., one of the nation's largest discount brokerage firms.

the very definition of what banking or financial services entail expands almost daily. many financiers would include real estate brokerage, executive relocation and sophisticated communications networks as part of their ''financial services'' package.

banks are busy sending up communications satellites and building earth stations to receive signals from outer space. and a number of the nonfinancial companies that are expanding their financial businesses, such as the international telephone and telegraph corp., happen also to be in communications.

the reason: financial services is, most basically, the movement of money, and the movement depends on high-technology communications. thus, american express spent about $250 million this year to operate and expand its computer operations. and it is spending another $35 million to build an earth station in salt lake city that will enable it to approve transactions within seconds anywhere in the world.

such expenses, plus the growing competition from new entries into the field, have been prompting mergers of once fiercely independent concerns. the bache group has been swallowed by the prudential insurance co. shearson loeb rhoades is part of american express. dean witter reynolds is becoming part of sears. salomon brothers was merged into the phibro corp., a large commodities-trading company, and dillon read was acquired by the bechtel family, owner of the world-renowned engineering firm.

does it make sense and where will it end? to companies already in some aspects of the financial business, it seems that the only way to compete is to offer a full range of services - to become a financial department store. to those who are not yet in it, providing financial services appears to have a lot of obvious pluses:

- to industrial companies that have been trying to keep up with costly pollution regulations, finance seems exquisitely clean. - to companies in heavy industry that need to spend billions of dollars to ''reindustrialize'' out-of-date plants, entry into the financial business seems cheap.

- to corporations that have been hurt by high labor costs, financial services seems not to be labor-intensive. - to industries that have been badly hurt by competition from foreign imports, finance seems impervious to inroads from abroad. but the rush may well be risky, as those with more experience in the field have found. like many other industries, the financial services business tends to be cyclical. securities firms are very attractive investments now because most have performed well for the past few years. that certainly has not always been the case, however, and may not always be. the financial services field is becoming both more capital- and labor-intensive, some analysts say. as noted, to efficiently serve a mass market, huge sums must be invested in technology. and it takes highly paid executives - a lot of them - to deal with the more sophisticateded individualized needs of upscale customers.

finally, what seems to be highly profitable often isn't. take the money-market funds, which have attracted more than $175 billion in the last few years. merrill lynch, whose money-market fund accounts for about one-fifth of the market, doesn't claim that the fund itself is making any money. merrill hopes that the fund will generate other, more profitable, business.

that was the dream commercial banks lived with for years, until competition forced them to figure out whether they really were earning money on many of their services. the answer, for the most part, turned out to be no, and that is why many banks today are raising the price of their consumer services.

each financial service, as many banks have learned to the tune of heavy losses, is a very different business. because a company knows how to make mortgages does not mean it knows how to make a personal loan or underwrite insurance.

but the trend toward financial conglomeration is real and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, as witnessed by the following vignettes of a number of nonbank companies that have become significant factors in the financial-services business."

according to catholic theology, a valid marriage may not be dissolved while one of the partners is living. like any law, the application depends on the interpretation of the canons given by the church's courts, but father morrisey said the flexibility of the new canons allowed pastors and bishops to make crucial decisions about church life.","pittsburgh, march 13— specific details of a revised legal code for the roman catholic church are emerging here at the first meeting in the united states to examine a draft of the first changes in the code since 1917.

while the general outlines of the code have been discussed since the draft was completed late last year, the actual canons are just becoming available in unofficial english translations.

among other things, the code expands the discretionary powers of individual bishops and national conferences of bishops. it also stipulates that lay people have a responsibilty to help govern the church and broadens the reasons for which marriages may be deemed invalid. the revision, in the opinion of theologians, is more flexible, tolerant and ''pastoral'' than the code now in force.

a recognition that the needs of the church vary from country to country and a desire to consolidate the changes wrought by the second vatican council caused the church to make the drastic revisions in its legal code. one of the advisers to the vatican commission that drafted the new law, the rev. francis g. morrisey of st. paul university in ottawa, also attributed the changes to the use of modern psychology as evidence in church courts. first of several meetings

father morrisey and several other experts on church law addressed a convocation sponsored by the diocese of pittsburgh that was attended this week by nearly 1,000 priests, nuns and lay people. the meeting, which ended today, is the first of several planned in the united states to introduce the new code to the nation's catholics.

theologians who helped prepare the code say the final draft describes a church conscious of the need to make its witness in a world where christians are a minority.

the church's law must ''foster intelligent, responsible, loving human beings, and not only force conformity,'' said the rev. michael j. himes, dean of immaculate conception seminary in huntington, l.i.

the penalty section of the code has been significantly reduced to show that the primary function of the law is to exhort the faithful to lead christian lives rather than threaten punishment for those who go astray, theologians say. 20 years of work completed

the final draft of the laws, known as ''canons'' from the greek word for ''norm,'' was completed last fall after more than 20 years of work.

the exact date of its release is not yet known, but last month pope john paul ii allowed the vatican's printing office to begin setting type for the publication of the nearly 2,000 canons in the code.

the pope has the right to alter the draft, but father morrisey said he did not believe the pontiff would make extensive changes in the code. when it is finally approved, the code will become binding on the world's more than 500 million roman catholics.

the code of canon law, while shorter than the one that went into effect in 1917, deals with all aspects of church life, from the administration of the sacraments to the duties of the bishops.

the new code pays particular attention to the role of lay people in the church, calling for ''prudent recognition of the rights of all christians,'' according to an unofficial english translation of one canon.

but it is the attitude behind the new canons rather than the specifics of the laws that shows how the church's law has changed, according to the rev. thomas p. doyle, a canon lawyer who is secretary of the vatican's delegation to the united states. 'ongoing effect' of sacraments

''the old law was concerned with the right form and valid execution of the sacraments,'' father doyle said. ''the proposed canons stress the ongoing effect that the sacraments have on the faithful.''

lay people most often come in contact with church law when they arrange baptisms or marriages, and it is in these sections that some of the most radical changes are proposed.

for example, the new canons stipulate that pastors are to take pains to prepare parents for the baptism of their children. the intent, said father doyle, is to teach that baptism places certain obligations on parents and to avoid the impression that the sacrament is merely a social ritual.

''the emphasis on pastoral care is a totally new element in the section of the code dealing with marriage,'' said msgr. john a. alesandro, chancellor of the diocese of rockville centre on long island, who is a consultant to the theologians preparing the new code. ''the marriage canons outline general principles,'' he said. specific regulations may be determined in the local diocese. 'impediments' to marriage

according to catholic theology, a valid marriage may not be dissolved while one of the partners is living. divorced catholics are not allowed to remarry in the church while their former spouse is alive; if they remarry without dispensation from the church they are technically barred from receiving holy communion. but the church teaches that if certain ''impediments'' existed, the former marriage was invalid and the parties are free to marry again.

by expanding the way the church views the ''impediments'' to marriage, the church is able to defend the permanence of marriage but still admit that some people contract marriages that are invalid in the eyes of the church.

like any law, the application depends on the interpretation of the canons given by the church's courts, but father morrisey said the flexibility of the new canons allowed pastors and bishops to make crucial decisions about church life.

the vatican has been critical of the number of marriage anullments granted in the united states, but monsignor alesandro said the new code was not likely to make it more difficult to get an invalid marriage annulled."

mobile shopping is largely done on tablets, and not smartphones. moreover, the term mobile shopping is somewhat of a misnomer. yes, people use mobile devices to window shop. but much of the buying is done at home from the living room sofa, and not from a park bench, subway or the sidelines of a children’s soccer game, according to analysts. “the smartphone is actually a terrible device to complete a transaction on,” says sucharita mulpuru, an analyst for forrester forr , the technology consulting company. “there’s no question that the tablet is easier.”

last year, tablets accounted for 3.2% of all u.s. online retail sales, more than double the 1.5% share for smartphones, according to a survey of 55 online retailers by forrester. the reasons for the gap boil down to this: smartphone screens are so tiny that browsing products online and entering credit card information is a pain.

of course, compared to overall e-commerce, mobile shopping is miniscule. but it is growing quickly and is expected to account for a far greater share of online retailing in the coming years. mobile shopping represented 10% of e-commerce in the quarter ending in september, according to comscore scor . on certain days, like black friday, the shopping-crazy day following thanksgiving, mobile devices accounted for 16% of all sales, ibm ibm said.

companies like ebay ebay consider mobile shopping to be critical to their futures. john donahoe, ebay’s chief executive, predicts that shoppers using mobile devices will spend $10 billion on his site this year, double the amount in 2011.

despite the high expectations, retailers are still grappling with how to deal with the shift in consumer behavior. the field is so nascent that it’s difficult for companies to know what to do or how to measure success. experimentation is common. spending a lot of money can be hard to justify in the short-term, however, because of the limited sales generated.

at ebags, an online retailer in denver, tablets accounted for 10.8% of overall traffic in the latest quarter and around 10.4% of sales. meanwhile, smartphones represented 8.4% of overall traffic, but only 2.9% of sales. peter cobb, chief executive for ebags, explained that tablet users behave much like people on desktop computers or laptops. shoppers on tablets meander around retail sites, watch product videos and buy what they want – all while sipping wine in front of the television.

smartphone users, in contrast, are more pressed for time and on a “search and destroy” mission, as cobb put it. people want to get in, compare prices and get out until they go home and complete a purchase using their home computer, so to avoid any hassles in the check out process. “the reality is that there are two different shopping experiences,” cobb says.

the greater success in getting tablet users to buy comes despite a big disadvantage in numbers. there are around 137 million smartphones in the united states compared with only 61 million tablets, according to forrester. the relative numbers show just how little sales smartphones drive, at least directly. average order sizes on smartphones are also smaller at $134.37 versus $159.28 for tablets.

still, smartphones play an important role for retailers. people use them to research products before making purchases from home. additionally, many shoppers do so before visiting a bricks and mortar store. comparing prices inside stores and scanning qr codes is also common.

such behavior, known as showrooming, is a sore point with some retail executives, who complain about shoppers eyeballing products in their stores that they intend to buy from online rivals. nordstrom’s jwn , target tgt and saks fifth avenue sks have taken an opposite approach by installing wi-fi in their stores to help customers connect online through their smartphones.

ignoring the fact that customers are using smartphones in stores is futile, the theory goes. in any case, smartphones can potentially drive more business if retailers use it to their advantage. a study this year by deloitte consulting, for example, that found that mobile phones influence 5.1% of all in-store retail sales, or around $159 billion in transactions. that amount far exceeds the $12 billion consumers will spend via direct mobile shopping, the study said.

cobb, from ebags, says that he plans to make a number of adjustments to his mobile site over the next year to make it more appealing to shoppers using smartphones. by then, he’ll have a better idea of what to highlight by tracking the products that shoppers click on a lot versus the “dead spots” that get relatively few clicks. expect bigger buttons, he said, so that customers can more easily use their smartphone screen to navigate. letting customers search by brands is another key feature because smartphone users generally knowing what they want.

“i do believe it is our job to unlock the potential of smartphones because it’s only going to keep growing,” cobb says."
