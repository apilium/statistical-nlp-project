"shell’s big bet on liquefied natural gas (lng) is far from a sure thing. it is lng, not oil, that’s truly behind the european energy giant’s $70 billion acquisition of britain’s bg group, which was announced on wednesday. so, this deal seems pretty much centered on gaining and protecting market share. shell wants to be the undisputed leader in lng. to be sure, shell is no novice in this space. the company assisted in building the first lng gasification terminal in algeria in the 1960s, so it has been in the lng business from the very beginning. as the supply of lng has crept up over the years, the power of suppliers has waned. this means that many of the lng gasification projects shell has been developing for years, such as the gorgon lng project in northwestern australia or the sakhalin 2 lng project in siberia, may end up not being as lucrative as originally imagined. a record 70 mtpa of lng was traded on a spot or short-term basis in 2014, equating to 29% of its total global trade. a competitive spot market for lng might work to the advantage of certain suppliers, but it could also backfire if there is too much supply on the market at any given moment. that not only means that it will be much harder for spot cargoes to find a home but also means contract prices for lng bound for japan will also suffer, falling as much as 38% through 2016, according to australia & new zealand banking group. nowhere is this better illustrated than in australia, where both shell and bg have large lng interests. while that might be great news to consumers in japan, korea, and taiwan, it doesn’t bode well for shell’s acquisition of bg group.","while being bigger is usually better in the energy world, it may not pay off as well in the world of liquified natural gas."

"" as of late september, minnesota requires almost all diesel fuel sold in the state to be 2 percent biodiesel, and cincinnati started using a 30 percent biodiesel blend, b30, in its city buses because of concerns about fuel shortages after hurricane katrina. nelson's biowillie is aimed mostly at truckers and is usually sold as b20 (pure biodiesel can congeal in colder climates). ""i don't like the war,"" he said in the interview.

as 49ers’ season winds down, distractions are ramping up

for a 7-7 team that is out of the playoffs and should be relatively irrelevant, the 49ers certainly are insistent on gobbling up headlines and media space. first, the jim harbaugh-to-michigan rumor. michigan could be sometime in his future, but not now, while he’s in the prime of his career. but that kind of payday could change the script. that makes sense: that’s what sean payton, the most highly paid coach in the nfl, makes. as the mcdonald news was coming down and the harbaugh rumors were bubbling up, the team chose that moment to e-mail fans with notification of how they can pay for their season tickets for 2015. e-mail: akillion@sfchronicle.com twitter: @annkillion","if the first-place warriors and world champion giants and competitive sharks expected the 49ers to fade gently into the good night with their playoff elimination, well, good luck with that.  [...] the jim harbaugh-to-michigan rumor.  on wednesday, there was a report that michigan has offered harbaugh a six-year, $49 million contract that would make him the highest-paid college coach.  most believe that harbaugh would prefer to stay in the nfl, and eventually hoist a lombardi trophy as his brother and his archrival, pete carroll, have.  [...] the ray mcdonald sexual-assault investigation and subsequent release by the 49ers.  would the 49ers have been as tough with mcdonald, who has been playing well the past month, if they were still in the postseason picture? i doubt it, but then i’ve been a good student of the 49ers’ season-long tutorial in cynical moves and mercenary actions.    since tweeting an apology to fans for the thanksgiving night loss to seattle, and saying that the performance was not acceptable, york has gone back into hiding.  [...] on top of all of that, the 49ers managed to further infuriate their fans.  the frayed allegiance of many fans is already beginning to snap, with the relocation, the high prices, the substandard product, the off-field misbehavior, the lack of accountability by the team."
