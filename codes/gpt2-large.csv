"in 1713, when he was only 25 years old, alexander pope assumed a momentous risk. but there has been a rejection of that rejection. the thing that best distinguishes this from all other translations of homer is that it alone equals the original in its ceaseless pour of verbal music. when pope's contemporaries praised him for his ''numbers,'' they were referring not to the fairly obvious metrical system of the heroic couplet but to the euphony he achieved within its constraints. the relatively enclosed nature of the system concentrates attention on every syllable in the line, on continual shifts in the position and degree of pause marked by metrical breaks (caesuras), on sound effects used to emphasize the careful alterations in word order. the sputtering rage of achilles is marked by double caesuras and stammering short u sounds (-ious, thus, -rupt-) in this couplet's second line:

here on the monarch's speech achilles broke

and furious thus / and interrupting / spoke. ajax's shield is tough

meanwhile, conway said, seattle's shipping industry is facing steeper competition from other ports and could be under threat by the widening of the panama canal. under the agreement, the city and county would contribute $200 million total, obtained via bonds, to the arena project if hansen can nail down both an nba and nhl team. if only an nba team is involved, the city would contribute $115 million and the county would front just $5 million. but beyers said it is still unknown how a new sports arena with two new teams would affect the economy of the entire region. much of the money generated would go to a handful of high-paid professional athletes, to hansen's ownership group and to the city of seattle.

"fortune — if you were to list the factors with the biggest potential impact on the business world over the next few decades, you’d likely cite some common themes – evolving technology, the globalization of markets, and fiscal challenges in western countries, perhaps. but here’s one you might not have considered: women. while these women have been overlooked in many markets — and actively suppressed in others — they are increasingly taking their place in the global economy, as both employees and entrepreneurs. as of may 2012, more than 6,000 women had enrolled in or graduated from the program, and goldman has begun working with the public sector and nongovernmental organizations to increase the program’s reach. all of these changes raise an intriguing question: as more women join the workforce over time, how will fortune’s most powerful women (mpw) list change in the coming decades? more: how a bra seller found her fit

nfl teams now have the power to stop television blackouts of their home games, but that doesn't mean they'll do so. the nfl blackout policy dates back to an act of congress in 1961 preventing home games from showing on tv stations that broadcast within a 75-mile radius of the stadium if tickets aren't sold out 72 hours before kickoff. the buffalo bills, cincinnati bengals and san diego chargers didn't feel quite as strongly and stuck to the 100 percent mark despite blacking out games in each of the past two seasons and trying to pry hundreds of millions in stadium construction and improvement costs out of their local governments. never mind that local taxpayers picked up nearly 90 percent of four-year-old lucas oil stadium's $720 million cost, according to the national sports fan coalition advocacy group. if you think back when they passed the sales to finance the stadiums [in 1996], they did it so people could come down to the stadiums and watch games. um, mike, maybe it's because you threatened to move the team back in 1995. we rely heavily on ticket sales as a primary revenue stream. number of television blackouts last year: 0 number of blackouts in the past five years: 7

beijing/singapore, aug 21 (reuters) - an intensifying rivalry between china's two top oil traders chinaoil and unipec is whipsawing asia's oil market, pitting the state-owned firms against each other in a battle for control of the region's crude benchmark. unipec, which trades for asia's largest refiner sinopec corp , is headed by simon chen, both 20-year veterans. ""with their rich trading experience, these new managers are more conscious of making a bigger impact than their predecessors,"" said a senior trading source with direct knowledge of the matter. in a series of buying sprees that began in october last year, chinaoil has been snapping up record numbers of oil cargoes during a pricing mechanism that sets benchmark pricing for 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil sold in asia, about 13 percent of the global consumption. the strong bidding has pushed up the benchmark price, fuelling speculation that chinaoil was aiming to reap big profits on positions it had taken in the derivatives markets.

"with market basket’s finances growing increasingly dire, family members fighting over the grocery chain have promised to make an all-out effort to reach a deal to rescue the company by the end of the week, according to people briefed on the discussions. arthur t. demoulas is trying to buy the 50.5 percent of the chain owned by his cousin and longtime foe, arthur s. demoulas, and other relatives. more evidence of the financial troubles came in a letter posted monday on a facebook page critical of the company’s current management, in which the chief executive of a major seafood supplier announced that his firm was cutting its ties with market basket. but in recent weeks, he said, payments did not arrive on time. he said in a statement that the problems with vendors were inevitable, given the decision by company employees who have refused to work, in solidarity with arthur t.

“the longtime employees that ran market basket’s buying and distribution system walked out on their jobs, their customers, and their vendors on july 18,” the statement said. after brokering negotiations sunday night, patrick and hassan issued statements saying that demoulas family members were making progress in resolving their dispute. other than the vow to work toward an agreement by friday, there were no details on monday about when or where the two sides would meet again. their involvement signaled a final push to end the extraordinary showdown over the company, which has put thousands of market basket’s part-time employees out of work and is threatening the jobs of thousands of full-time workers. the demoulas family has been at odds since the 1990s, when arthur s.’s side of the family won a lawsuit finding that arthur t.’s father, telemachus, had defrauded them out of their shares in the company.","with market basket’s finances growing increasingly dire, family members fighting over the grocery chain have promised to make an all-out effort to reach a deal to rescue the company by the end of the week, according to a person briefed on the discussions."

san francisco 49ers head coach jim harbaugh adjusts his cap before an nfl football game against the seattle seahawks, sunday, dec. more interesting is the fact that the offer was leaked. that makes sense: that’s what sean payton, the most highly paid coach in the nfl, makes. harbaugh has one year left on his deal, which pays him $5 million a year (his brother john makes $7 million). it’s difficult not to take a cynical view of an organization that crows about “due process” when it thinks it is a super bowl contender and can be helped by a player under investigation, but abandons it’s due-process stance once it is out of the playoffs and the player has done the bulk of his work for that year’s salary. and if the 49ers had taken a tough approach with mcdonald early in the season, could this subsequent police investigation have been avoided? it was nice that baalke showed up to answer questions instead of letting the head coach — whose job is to win games — answer all queries about team philosophy, standards and accountability.","if the first-place warriors and world champion giants and competitive sharks expected the 49ers to fade gently into the good night with their playoff elimination, well, good luck with that.  [...] the jim harbaugh-to-michigan rumor.  on wednesday, there was a report that michigan has offered harbaugh a six-year, $49 million contract that would make him the highest-paid college coach.  most believe that harbaugh would prefer to stay in the nfl, and eventually hoist a lombardi trophy as his brother and his archrival, pete carroll, have.  [...] the ray mcdonald sexual-assault investigation and subsequent release by the 49ers.  would the 49ers have been as tough with mcdonald, who has been playing well the past month, if they were still in the postseason picture? i doubt it, but then i’ve been a good student of the 49ers’ season-long tutorial in cynical moves and mercenary actions.    since tweeting an apology to fans for the thanksgiving night loss to seattle, and saying that the performance was not acceptable, york has gone back into hiding.  [...] on top of all of that, the 49ers managed to further infuriate their fans.  the frayed allegiance of many fans is already beginning to snap, with the relocation, the high prices, the substandard product, the off-field misbehavior, the lack of accountability by the team."
