"in 1713, when he was only 25 years old, alexander pope assumed a momentous risk. but there has been a rejection of that rejection. the thing that best distinguishes this from all other translations of homer is that it alone equals the original in its ceaseless pour of verbal music. when pope's contemporaries praised him for his ''numbers,'' they were referring not to the fairly obvious metrical system of the heroic couplet but to the euphony he achieved within its constraints. the relatively enclosed nature of the system concentrates attention on every syllable in the line, on continual shifts in the position and degree of pause marked by metrical breaks (caesuras), on sound effects used to emphasize the careful alterations in word order. the sputtering rage of achilles is marked by double caesuras and stammering short u sounds (-ious, thus, -rupt-) in this couplet's second line:

here on the monarch's speech achilles broke

and furious thus / and interrupting / spoke. ajax's shield is tough

meanwhile, conway said, seattle's shipping industry is facing steeper competition from other ports and could be under threat by the widening of the panama canal. under the agreement, the city and county would contribute $200 million total, obtained via bonds, to the arena project if hansen can nail down both an nba and nhl team. if only an nba team is involved, the city would contribute $115 million and the county would front just $5 million. but beyers said it is still unknown how a new sports arena with two new teams would affect the economy of the entire region. much of the money generated would go to a handful of high-paid professional athletes, to hansen's ownership group and to the city of seattle.
